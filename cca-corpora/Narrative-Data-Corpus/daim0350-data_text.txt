#1You are standing at the end of a road before a small brickbuilding.  Around you is a forest.  A small stream flows outof the building and down a gully.#2You have walked up a hill, still in the forest.  The roadslopes back down the other side of the hill.  There is abuilding in the distance.#3You are inside a building, a well house for a large spring.#4You are in a valley in the forest beside a stream tumblingalong a rocky bed.#5You are in open forest, with a deep valley to one side.#6You are in open forest near both a valley and a road.#7At your feet all the water of the stream splashes into a2-inch slit in the rock.  Downstream the streambed is bare rock.#8You are in a 20-foot depression floored with bare dirt.  Setinto the dirt is a strong steel grate mounted in concrete.A dry streambed leads into the depression.#9You are in a small chamber beneath a 3x3 steel grate to thesurface.  A low crawl over cobbles leads inward to the West.#10You are crawling over cobbles in a low passage.  There is adim light at the east end of the passage.#11You are in a debris room filled with stuff washed in from thesurface.  A low wide passage with cobbles becomes pluggedwith mud and debris here, but an awkward canyon leadsupward and west.  A note on the wall says:       Magic Word "XYZZY"#12You are in an awkward sloping east/west canyon.#13You are in a splendid chamber thirty feet high.  The wallsare frozen rivers of orange stone.  An awkward canyon and agood passage exit from east and west sides of the chamber.#14At your feet is a small pit breathing traces of white mist.An east passage ends here except for a small crack leadingon.#15You are at one end of a vast hall stretching forward out ofsight to the west.  There are openings to either side.Nearby, a wide stone staircase leads downward.  The hallis filled with wisps of white mist swaying to and froalmost as if alive.  A cold wind blows up the staircase.There is a passage at the top of a dome behind you.#16The crack is far too small for you to follow.#17You are on the east bank of a fissure slicing clear acrossthe hall.  The mist is quite thick here, and the fissureis too wide to jump.#18This is a low room with a crude note on the wall.  Thenote says:       You won't get it up the steps.#19You are in the hall of the mountain king, with passagesoff in all directions.#20You are at the bottom of the pit with a broken neck.#21You didn't make it.#22The dome is unclimbable.#23You are at the west end of the twopit room.  There is alarge hole in the wall above the pit at this end of theroom.#24You are that the bottom of the eastern pit in the twopitroom.  There is a small pool of oil in one corner of thepit.#25You are at the bottom of the western pit in the towpit room.There is a large hole in the wall about 25 feet above you.#26You clamber up the plant and scurry through the hole at thetop.#27You are on the west side of the fissure in the hall of mists.#28You are in a low N/S passage at a hole in the floor.  Thehole goes down to an E/W passage.#29You are in the south side chamber.#30You are in the west side chamber of the hall of themountain king.  A passage continues west and up here.#31>$<#32You can't get by the snake.#33You are in a large room, with a passage to the south,a passage to the west, and a wall of broken rock to theeast.  There is a large "Y2" on a rock in the room's center.#34You are in a jumble of rock, with cracks everywhere.#35You're at a low window overlooking a huge pit, whichextends up out of sight.  A floor is indistinctly visibleover 50 feet below.  Traces of white mist cover the floorof the pit, becoming thicker to the right.  Marks in thedust around the window would seem to indicate thatsomeone has been here recently.  Directly across the pitfrom you and 25 feet away there is a similar windowlooking into a lighted room.  A shadowy figure canbe seen there peering back at you.#36You are in a dirty broken passage.  To the east is acrawl.  To the west is a large passage.  Above you isanother passage.#37You are on the brink of a small clean climbable pit.  Acrawl leads west.#38You are in the bottom of a small pit with a little stream,which enters and exits through tiny slits.#39You are in a large room full of dusty rocks.  There is abig hole in the floor.  There are cracks everywhere, anda passage leading east.#40You have crawled through a very low wide passage parallelto and north of the hall of mists.#41You are at the west end of hall of mists.  A low wide crawlcontinues west and another goes north.  To the south is alittle passage 6 feet off the floor.#42You are in a maze of twisty little passages, all alike.#43You are in a maze of twisty little passages, all alike.#44You are in a maze of twisty little passages, all alike.#45You are in a maze of twisty little passages, all alike.#46Dead end#47Dead end#48Dead end#49You are in a maze of twisty little passages, all alike.#50You are in a maze of twisty little passages, all alike.#51You are in a maze of twisty little passages, all alike.#52You are in a maze of twisty little passages, all alike.#53You are in a maze of twisty little passages, all alike.#54Dead end#55You are in a maze of twisty little passages, all alike.#56Dead end#57You are on the brink of a thirty foot pit with a massiveorange column down one wall.  You could climb down here butyou could not get back up.  The maze continues at this level.#58Dead end#59You have crawled through a very low wide passage paralledto and north of the hall of mists.#60You are at the east end of a very long hall apparentlywithout side chambers.  To the east a low wide crawlslants up.  To the north a round two foot hole slantsdown.#61You are at the west end of a very long featureless hall.The hall joins up with a narrow north/south passage.#62You are at a crossover of a high N/S passage and a lowE/W one.#63Dead end#64You are at a complex junction.  A low hands and knees passagefrom the north joins a higher crawl from the east to makea walking passage going west.  There is also a large roomabove.  The air is damp here.#65You are in bedquilt, a long east/west passage with holeseverywhere.  To explore at random select north, south, upor down.#66You are in a room whose walls resemble swiss cheese.  Obvious passages go west, east, ne, and nw.  Part of theroom is occupied by a large bedrock block.#67You are at the east end of the twopit room.  The floorhere is littered with thin rock slabs, which make it easyto descend the pits.  There is a path here bypassingthe pits to connect passages from east and west.There are holes all over, but the only bit one is onthe wall directly over the west pit where you can'tget at it.#68You are in a large low circular chamber whose floor isan immense slab fallen from the ceiling (slab room).East and west there once were large passages, but theyare now filled with boulders.  Low small passages gonorth and south, and the south one quickly bends westaround the boulders.#69You are in a secret N/S canyon above a large room.#70You are in a secret N/S canyon above a sizable passage.#71You are in a secret canyon at a junction of three canyons,bearing north, south and se.  The north one is as tall asthe other two combined.#72You are in a large low room.  Crawls lead north, se, and sw.#73Dead end crawl.#74You are in a secret canyon which here runs E/W.  It crossesover a very tight canyon 15 feet below.  If you go down youmay not be able to get back up.#75You are at a wide place in a very tight N/S canyon.#76The canyon here becomes too tight to go further south.#77You are in a tall E/W canyon.  A low tight crawl goes 3feet north and seems to open up.#78The canyon runs into a mass of boulders -- dead end.#79The stream flows out through a pair of 1 foot diametersewer pipes.  It would be advisable to use the exit.#80You are in a maze of twisty little passages, all alike.#81Dead end.#82Dead end.#83You are in a maze of twisty little passages, all alike.#84You are in a maze of twisty little passages, all alike.#85Dead end.#86Dead end.#87You are in a maze of twisty little passages, all alike.#88You are in a long, narrow corridor stretching out of sightto the west.  At the eastern end is a hole through whichyou can see a profusion of leaves,#89There is nothing here to climb.  Use "up" or "out" to leavethe pit.#90You have climbed up the plant and out of the pit.#91You are at the top of a steep incline above a large room.You could climb down here, but you would not be able toclimb up.  There is a passage leading back to the north.#92You are in the giant room.  The ceiling is too high upfor your lamp to show it.  Cavernous passages lead east,north, and south.  On the west wall is scrawled theinscription:              "Fee Fie Foe Foo"       {sic}#93The passage here is blocked by a recent cave-in.#94You are at one end of an immense north/south passage.#95You are in a magnificent cavern with a rushing stream,which cascades over a sparkling waterfall into aroaring whirlpool which disappears through a hole inthe floor.  Passages exit to the south and west.#96You are in the soft room.  The walls are covered withheavy curtains, the floor with a thick pile carpet.Moss covers the ceiling.#97This is the oriental room.  Ancient oriental cave drawingscover the walls.  A gently sloping passage leads upwardto the north, another passage leads se, and a hands andknees crawl leads west.#98You are following a wide path around the outer edge of alarge cavern.  Far below, through a heavy white mist,strange splashing noises can be heard.  The mist rises upthrough a fissure in the ceiling.  The path exits to thesouth and west.#99You are in an alcove.  A small nw path seems to widenafter a short distance.  An extremely tight tunnel leadseast.  It looks like a very tight squeeze.  An eerielight can be seen at the other end.#100You're in a small chamber lit by an eerie green light.  Anextremely narrow tunnel exits to the west.  A dark corridorleads ne.#101You're in the dark-room.  A corridor leading south is theonly exit.#102You are in an arched hall.  A coral passage once continuedup and east from here, but is now blocked by debris.  Theair smells of sea water.#103You're in a large room carved out of sedimentary rock.The floor and walls are littered with bits of shellsimbedded in the stone.  A shallow passage proceedsdownward, and a somewhat steeper one leads up.  A lowhands and knees passage enters from the south.#104You are in a long sloping corridor with ragged sharp walls.#105You are in a cul-de-sac about eight feet across.#106You are in an anteroom leading to a large passage to theeast.  Small passages go west and up.  The remnants ofrecent digging are evident.  A sign in midair here says:       "Cave under construction beyond this point."              "Proceed at your own risk."             "Witt construction company"#107You are in a maze of twisty little passages, all different.#108You are at Witt's end.  Passages lead off in ALL directions.#109You are in a north/south canyon about 25 feet across.  Thefloor is covered by white mist seeping in from the north.The walls extend upward for well over 100 feet.  Suspendedfrom some unseen point far above you, an enormous two-sided mirror is hanging paralled to and midway betweenthe canyon walls.  (The mirror is obviously providedfor the use of the dwarves, who as you know, areextremely vain.)  A small window can be seen in eitherwall, some fifty feet up.#110You're at a low window overlooking a huge pit, whichextends up out of sight.  A floor is indistinctly visibleover 50 feet below.  Traces of white mist cover the floorof the pit, becoming thicker to the left.  Marks in thedust around the window would seem to indicate thatsomeone has been here recently.  Directly across the pitfrom you and 25 feet away there is a similar windowlooking into a lighted room.  A shadowy figure can be seenthere peering back at you.#111A large stalactite extends from the roof and almost reachesthe floor below.  You could climb down it, and jump fromit to the floor, but having done so you would be unable toreach it to climb back up.#112You are in a little maze of twisting passages, all different.#113You are at the edge of a large underground reservoir.  Anopaque cloud of white mist fills the room and risesrapidly upward.  The lake is fed by a stream which tumblesout of a hole in the wall about 10 feet overhead andsplashes noisily into the water somewhere within the mist.The only passage goes back toward the south.#114Dead end.#115You are at the northeast end of an immense room, evenlarger than the giant room.  It appears to be a repositoryfor the "adventure" program.  Massive torches far overheadbathe the room with smoky yellow light.  Scattered aboutyou can be seen a pile of bottles (all of them empty), anursery of young beanstalks murmuring quietly, a bed ofoysters, a bundle of black rods with rusty stars on theirends, and a collection of brass lanterns.  Off to one sidea great many Dwarves are sleeping on the floor, snoringloudly.  A sign nearby reads:        "Do NOT disturb the Dwarves!"An immense mirror is hanging against one wall, andstretches to the other end of the room, where variousother sundry objects can be glimpsed dimly in the distance.#116You are at the southwest end of the repository.  To oneside is a pit full of fierce green snakes.  On the otherside is a row of small wicker cages, each of which containsa little sulking bird.  In one corner is a bundle ofblack rods with rusty marks on their ends.  A largenumber of velvet pillows are scattered about on the floor.A vast mirror stretches off to the northeast.  At yourfeet is a large steel grate, next to which is a signwhich reads:     "Treasure vault.  Keys in main office."#117You are on one side of a large deep chasm.  A heavy whitemist rising up from below obscures all view of the farside.  A sw path leads away from the chasm into a windingcorridor.#118You are in a long winding corridor sloping out of sightin both directions.#119You are in a secret canyon which exits to the north and east.#120You are in a secret canyon which exits to the north and east.#121You are in a secret canyon which exits to the north and east.#122You are on the far side of the chasm.  A ne path leads awayfrom the chasm on this side.#123You're in a long east/west corridor.  A faint rumbling noisecan be heard in the distance.#124The path forks here.  The left fork leads northeast.  A dullrumbling seems to get louder in that direction.  The rightfork leads southeast down a gentle slope.  The maincorridor enters from the west.#125The walls are quite warm here.  From the north can be hearda steady roar, so loud that the entire cave seems to betrembling.  Another passage leads south, and a low crawlgoes east.#126You are on the edge of a breath-taking view.  Far belowyou is an active volcano, from which great gouts of moltenlava come surging out, cascading back down into the depths.The glowing rock fills the farthest reaches of the cavernwith a blood-red glare, giving everything an eerie,macabre appearance.  The air is filled with flickeringsparks of ash and a heavy smell of brimstone.  The wallsare hot to the touch, and the thundering of the volcanodrowns out all other sounds.  Embedded in the jagged rooffar overhead are myriad formations composed of purewhite alabaster, which scatter their murky light intosinister apparitions upon the walls.  To one side is adeep gorge, filled with a bizarre chaos of torturedrock which seems to have been crafted by the DevilHimself.  An immense river of fire crashes out fromthe depths of the volcano, burns its way through thegorge, and plummets into a bottomless pit far off to yourleft.  To the right, an immense geyser of blisteringsteam erupts continuously from a barren island in thecenter of a sulfurous lake, which bubbles ominously.The far right wall is aflame with an incandescence of itsown, which lends an additional infernal splendor to thealready hellish scene.  A dark, foreboding passage exitsto the south.#127You are in a small chamber filled with large boulders.The walls are very warm, causing the air in the roomto be almost stifling from the heat.  The only exitis a crawl heading west, through which is cominga low rumbling.#128You are walking along a gently sloping north/south passagelined with oddly shaped limestone formations.#129You are standing at the entrance to a large, barrenroom.  A sign posted above the entrance reads:       "Caution!  Bear in room!"#130You are inside a barren room.  The center of the roomis completely empty except for some dust.  Marks inthe dust lead away toward the far end of the room.The only exit is the way you came in.#131You are in a maze of twisting little passages, all different.#132You are in a little maze of twisty passages, all different.#133You are in a twisting maze of little passages, all different.#134You are in a twisting little maze of passages, all different.#135You are in a twisty little maze of passages, all different.#136You are in a twisty maze of little passages, all different.#137You are in a little twisty maze of passages, all different.#138You are in a maze of little twisting passages, all different.#139You are in a maze of little twisty passages, all different.#140Dead end.#1You're at end of road again.#2You're at hill in road.#3You're inside building.#4You're in valley.#5You're in forest.#6You're in forest.#7You're at slit in streambed.#8You're outside grate.#9You're below the grate.#10You're in cobble crawl.#11You're in debris room.#12You are in an awkward sloping east/west canyon.#13You're in bird chamber.#14You're at top of small pit.#15You're in hall of mists.#16The crack is far too small for you to follow.#17You're on east bank of fissure.#18You're in nugget of gold room.#19You're in hall of mt. king.#20You are the the bottom of the pit with a broken neck.#21You didn't make it.#22The dome is unclimbable.#23You're at west end of twopit room.#24You're in east pit.#25You're in west pit.#26You clamber up the plant and scurry through the hole at thetop.#27You are on the west side of the fissure in the hall of mists.#28You are in a low N/S passage at a hole in the floor.

Magic is saidto work in the cave.  I will be your eyes and hands.  Directme with commands of 1 or 2 words.  I should warn you that Ilook at only the first five letters of each word, so you'llhave to enter "Northeast" as "ne" to distinguish it from"North".  (Should you get stuck, type "help" for somegeneral hints).#2A little dwarf with a big knife blocks your way.#3A little dwarf just walked around a corner, saw you,threw a little axe at you which missed, cursed, and ran away.#4There is a threatening little dwarf in the room with you!#5One sharp, nasty knife is thrown at you!#6None of them hit you!#7One of them gets you!#8A hollow voice says "Plugh".#9There is no way to go that direction.#10I am unsure how you are facing.  Use compass points ornearby objects.#11I don't know in from out here.  Use compass points or namesomething in the general direction you want to go.#12I don't know how to apply that word here.#13I don't understand that!#14I'm game.  Would you care to explain how?#15Sorry, but I am not allowed to give more detail.  I willrepeat the long description of your location.#16It is now pitch dark.  If you proceed you will likely fallinto a pit.#17If you prefer, simply type W rather than West.#18Are you trying to catch the bird?#19The bird is frightened right now and you cannot catchit no matter what you try.  Perhaps you might try later.#20Are you trying to somehow deal with the snake?#21You can't kill the snake, or drive it away, or avoid it,or anything like that.  There is a way to get by, but youdon't have the necessary resources right now.#22Do you really want to quit now?#23You fell into a pit and broke every bone in your body!#24You are already carrying it!#25You can't be serious!#26The bird was unafraid when you entered, but as you approachit becomes disturbed and you cannot catch it.#27You can catch the bird, but you cannot carry it.#28There is nothing here with a lock!#29You aren't carrying it!#30The little bird attacks the green snake, and in anastounding flurry drives the snake away.#31You have no keys!#32It has no lock.#33I don't know how to lock or unlock such a thing.#34It was already locked.#35The grate is now locked.#36The grate is now unlocked.#37It was already unlocked.#38You have no source of light.#39Your lamp is now on.#40Your lamp is now off.#41There is no way to get past the bear to unlock the chain,_which is probably just as well.#42Nothing happens.#43Where?#44There is nothing here to attack.#45The little bird is now dead.  Its body disappears.#46Attacking the snake both doesn't work and is very dangerous.#47You killed a little dwarf.#48You attack a little dwarf, but he dodges out of the way.#49With what? Your bare hands?#50Good try, but that is an old worn-out magic word.#51I know of places, actions, and things.  Most of my vocabularydescribes places and is used to move you there.  To move, trywords like forest, building, downstream, enter, east, west,north, south, up or down.  I know about a few specialobjects, like a black rod hidden in the cave.  These objectscan be manipulated using some of the action words I know.Usually you will need to give both the object and actionwords (In either order), but sometimes I can infer theobject from the verb alone.  Some objects also imply verbs;in particular, "inventory" implies "take inventory", whichcauses me to give you a list of what you're carrying.  Theobjects have side effects; for instance, the rod scares thebird.  Usually people having trouble moving just needto try a few more words.  Usually people trying unsuccessfullyto manipulate an object are attempting something beyond their(or my!) capabilities and should try a completely differenttack.  To speed the game you can sometimes move long distanceswith a single word.  For example, "building" usually gets youto the building from anywhere above ground except when lostin the forest.  Also, note that cave passages turn a lot, andthat leaving a room to the north does not guarantee enteringthe next from the south.Good luck!#52It misses!#53It gets you!#54OK#55You can't unlock the keys.#56You have crawled around in some little holes and wound upback in the main passage.#57I don't know where the cave is, but hereabouts no streamcan run on the surface for very long.  I would try the stream.#58I need more detailed instructions to do that.#59I can only tell you what you see as you move about andmanipulate things.  I cannot tell you where remote things are.#60I don't know that word.#61What?#62Are you trying to get into the cave?#63The grate is very solid and has a hardened steel lock.  Youcannot enter without a key, and there are no keys nearby.I would recommend looking elsewhere for the keys.#64The trees of the forest are large hardwood oak and maple,with an occasional grove of pine or spruce.  There is quitea bit of undergrowth, largely birch and ash saplings plusnondescript bushes of various sorts.  This time of year visibility is quite restricted by all the leaves, but travelis quite easy if you detour around the spruce and berrybushes.#65		Welcome to ADVENTURE!		=====================	-Original development by Willie Crowther.	-Major features added by Don Woods.	-Conversion to BDS  C by J.

Even with ashovel progress is unlikely.#67Blasting requires dynamite.#68I'm as confused as you are.#69Mist is a white vapor, usually water.  Seen from time to timein caverns.  It can be found anywhere but is frequently asign of a deep pit leading down to water.#70Your feet are now wet.#71I think I just lost my appetite.#72Thank you.  It was delicious!#73You have taken a drink from the stream.  The water tastesstrongly of minerals, but is not unpleasant.  It is extremelycold.#74The bottle of water is now empty.#75Rubbing the electric lamp is not particularly rewarding.Anyway, nothing exciting happens.#76Peculiar.  Nothing unexpected happens.#77Your bottle is empty and the ground is wet.#78You can't pour that.#79Watch it!#80Which way?#81Oh dear, you seem to have gotten yourself killed.  I mightbe able to help you out, but I've never really done thisbefore.  Do you want me to try to reincarnate you?#82All right.  But don't blame me if something goes wr......                    --- POOF !! ---You are engulfed in a cloud of orange smoke.  Coughing andgasping, you emerge from the smoke and find...#83You clumsy oaf, you've done it again!  I don't know how longI can keep this up.  Do you want me to try reincarnatingyou again?#84Okay, now where did i put my orange smoke? ... > POOF! <Everything disappears in a dense cloud of orange smoke.#85Now you've really done it!  I'm out of orange smoke!  Youdon't expect me to do a decent reincarnation without anyorange smoke, do you?#86Okay, If you're so smart, do it yourself!  I'm leaving!#87Reserved#88Reserved#89Reserved#90Reserved#91Sorry, but I no longer seem to remember how it was yougot here.#92You can't carry anything more.  You'll have to drop somethingfirst.#93You can't go through a locked steel grate!#94I believe what you want is right here with you.#95You don't fit through a two-inch slit!#96I respectfully suggest you go across the bridge insteadof jumping.#97There is no way across the fissure.#98You're not carrying anything.#99You are currently holding the following:#100It's not hungry (It's merely pinin' for the Fjords).  BesidesYou have no bird seed.#101The snake has now devoured your bird.#102There's nothing here it wants to eat (Except perhaps you).#103You fool, Dwarves eat only coal!  Now you've madehim REALLY mad !!#104You have nothing in which to carry it.#105Your bottle is already full.#106There is nothing here with which to fill the bottle.#107Your bottle is now full of water.#108Your bottle is now full of oil.#109You can't fill that.#110Don't be ridiculous!#111The door is extremely rusty and refuses to open.#112The plant indignantly shakes the oil off its leaves and asks:"Water?".#113The hinges are quite thoroughly rusted now and won't budge.#114The oil has freed up the hinges so that the door will now move,although it requires some effort.#115The plant has exceptionally deep roots and cannot be pulled free.#116The Dwarves' knives vanish as they strike the walls of the cave.#117Something you're carrying won't fit through the tunnel withyou.  You'd best take inventory and drop something.#118You can't fit this five-foot clam through that little passage!#119You can't fit this five foot oyster through that little passage!#120I advise you to put down the clam before opening it. >STRAIN!<#121I advise you to put down the oyster before opening it.>WRENCH!<#122You don't have anything strong enough to open the clam.#123You don't have anything strong enough to open the oyster.#124A glistening pearl falls out of the clam and rolls away.Goodness, this must really be an oyster.  (I never wasvery good at identifying bivalves.)  Whatever it is,it has now snapped shut again.#125The oyster creaks open, revealing nothing but oyster inside.It promptly snaps shut again.#126You have crawled around in some little holes and found yourway blocked by a recent cave-in.  You are now back in themain passage.#127There are faint rustling noises from the darkness behindyou.#128Out from the shadows behind you pounces a bearded pirate!"Har, har" he chortles, "I'll just take all this booty andhide it away with me chest deep in the maze!".  He snatchesyour treasure and vanishes into the gloom.#129A sepulchral voice reverberating through the cave says:"Cave closing soon.  All adventurers exit immediatelythrough main office."#130A mysterious recorded voice groans into life and announces:"This exit is closed.  Please leave via main office."#131It looks as though you're dead.  Well, seeing as how it's soclose to closing time anyway, I think we'll just call it a day.#132The sepulchral voice entones, "The cave is now closed."  Asthe echoes fade, there is a blinding flash of light (and asmall puff of orange smoke). . . . As your eyes refocus you look around and find...#133There is a loud explosion, and a twenty-foot hole appears inthe far wall, burying the Dwarves in the rubble.  You marchthrough the hole and find yourself in the main office, wherea cheering band of friendly elves carry the conqueringadventurer off into the sunset.#134There is a loud explosion, and a twenty-foot hole appears inthe far wall, burying the snakes in the rubble.  A river ofmolten lava pours in through the hole, destroyingeverything in its path, including you!!#135There is a loud explosion, and you are suddenly splashed acrossthe walls of the room.#136The resulting ruckus has awakened the Dwarves.  There are nowseveral threatening little Dwarves in the room with you!Most of them throw knives at you!  All of them get you!#137Oh, leave the poor unhappy bird alone.#138I daresay whatever you want is around here somewhere.#139I don't know the word "stop".   Use "quit" if you want togive up.#140You can't get there from here.#141You are being followed by a very large, tame bear.#142If you want to end your adventure early, say "quit".  Tosuspend you adventure such that you can continue latersay "suspend" (or "pause" or "save").  To see how wellyou're doing, say "score".  To get full credit for atreasure, you must have left it safely in the building,though you get partial credit just for locating it.You lose points for getting killed, or for quitting,though the former costs you more.  There are also pointsbased on how much (If any) of the cave you've managed toexplore;  in particular, there is a large bonus just forgetting in (to distinguish the beginners from the rest ofthe pack), and there are other ways to determine whetheryou've been through some of the more harrowing sections.If you think you've found all the treasures, just keepexploring for a while.  If nothing interesting happens, youhaven't found them all yet.  If something interesting DOEShappen, it means you're getting a bonus and have anopportunity to garner many more points in the master'ssection.  I may occasionally offer hints in you seem tobe having trouble.  If I do, I'll warn you inadvance how much it will affect your score to accept thehints.  Finally, to save paper, you may specify "brief",which tells me never to repeat the full description of a placeunless you explicitly ask me to.#143Do you indeed wish to quit now?#144There is nothing here with which to fill the vase.#145The sudden change in temperature has delicately shatteredthe vase.#146It is beyond your power to do that.#147I don't know how.#148It is too far up for you to reach.#149You killed a little Dwarf.  The body vanished in a cloudof greasy black smoke.#150The shell is very strong and impervious to attack.#151What's the matter, can't you read?  Now you'd best startover.#152The axe bounces harmlessly off the dragon's thick scales.#153The dragon looks rather nasty.  You'd best not try to get by.#154The little bird attacks the green dragon, and in anastounding flurry gets burnt to a cinder.  The ashes blow away.#155On what?#156Okay, from now on I'll only describe a place in full thefirst time you come to it.  To get the full descriptionsay "look".#157Trolls are close relatives with the rocks and have skin astough as that of a rhinoceros.  The troll fends off yourblows effortlessly.#158The troll deftly catches the axe, examines it carefully,and tosses it back, declaring, "Good workmanship,but it's not valuable enough.".#159The troll catches your treasure and scurries away out of sight.#160The troll refuses to let you cross.#161There is no longer any way across the chasm.#162Just as you reach the other side, the bridge buckles beneaththe weight of the bear, which was still following you around.You scrabble desperately for support, but as the bridge collapses you stumble back and fall into the chasm.#163The bear lumbers toward the troll, who lets out astartled shriek and scurries away.  The bear soon givesup pursuit and wanders back.#164The axe misses and lands near the bear where you can't getat it.#165With what?  Your bare hands?  Agains HIS bear hands??#166The bear is confused;  he only wants to be your friend.#167For crying out loud, the poor thing is already dead!#168The bear eagerly wolfs down your food, after which he seemsto calm down considerably, and even becomes rather friendly.#169The bear is still chained to the wall.#170The chain is still locked.#171The chain is now unlocked.#172The chain is now locked.#173There is nothing here to which the chain can be locked.#174There is nothing here to eat.#175Do you want the hint?#176Do you need help getting out of the maze?#177You can make the passages look less alike by dropping things.#178Are you trying to explore beyond the plover room?#179There is a way to explore that region without having toworry about falling into a pit.  None of the objectsavailable is immediately useful in descovering the secret.#180Do you need help getting out of here?#181Don't go west.#182Gluttony is not one of the Troll's vices.  Avarice, however, is.#183Your lamp is getting dim.. You'd best start wrapping this up,unless you can find some fresh batteries.  I seem to recallthere's a vending machine in the maze.  Bring some coinswith you.#184Your lamp has run out of power.#185There's not much point in wandering around out here, and youcan't explore the cave without a lamp.  So let's just callit a day.#186There are faint rustling noises from the darkness behind you.As you turn toward them, the beam of your lamp falls across abearded pirate.  He is carrying a large chest.  "Shiver metimbers!"  he cries, "I've been spotted!  I'd best hidemeself off to the maze and hide me chest!".  With that,he vanished into the gloom.#187Your lamp is getting dim.  You'd best go back forthose batteries.#188Your lamp is getting dim.. I'm taking the liberty of replacingthe batteries.#189Your lamp is getting dim, and you're out of spare batteries.You'd best start wrapping this up.#190I'm afraid the magazine is written in Dwarvish.#191"This is not the maze where the pirate leaves his treasurechest."#192Hmm, this looks like a clue, which means it'll cost you 10points to read it.  Should I go ahead and read it anyway?#193It says, "There is something strange about this place,such that one of the words I've always known now hasa new effect."#194It says the same thing it did before.#195I'm afraid I don't understand.#196"Congratulations on bringing light into the dark-room!"#197You strike the mirror a resounding blow, whereupon itshatters into a myriad tiny fragments.#198You have taken the vase and hurled it delicately to theground.#199You prod the nearest Dwarf, who wakes up grumpily, takesone look at you, curses, and grabs for his axe.#200Is this acceptable?#201There's no point in suspending a demonstration game.
