The walls are hot to the touch, and the thundering of the volcanodrowns out all other sounds.  Embedded in the jagged roof far overhead aremyriad formations composed of pure white alabaster, which scatter their murkylight into sinister apparitions upon the walls.  To one side is a deep gorge,filled with a bizarre chaos of tortured rock which seems to have been craftedby the Devil Himself.  An immense river of fire crashes out from the depths ofthe volcano, burns its way through the gorge, and plummets into a bottomlesspit far off to your left.  To the right, an immense geyser of blistering steamerupts continuously from a barren island in the center of a sulfurous lake,which bubbles ominously.  The far right wall is aflame with an incandescenceof its own, which lends an additional infernal splendor to the already hellishscene.

Once created,these adventure games can be shared with and enjoyed by others -- even if theydo not have a copy of the Adventure Game Toolkit themselves.  Using AGT thegame developer can create two distinct levels of adventure games:    STANDARD LEVEL games that require no programming experience (honestly!!),    only a fertile imagination.  These Standard Level games only require that    the game designer/writer generates the game using a word processor or text    editor to describe the various locations, objects and results of actions    that collectively make up the game.    PROFESSIONAL LEVEL games that also make use of AGT's special adventure game    metalanguage to create games as complex and rich as the game designer's    imagination and prose style will allow.  These games should be technically    comparable with the published text adventure games from firms like    Infocom.FEATURES OF THE ADVENTURE GAME TOOLKITAGT has a number of features that make it a very comprehensive adventure gamecreation product.  Some of these key features are:   *     "Look and feel" of Infocom adventure games with similar screen layout         and standard vocabulary and routines.   *     Large standard vocabulary with potential to define many more words         unique to a specific adventure.  Typical games can have a vocabulary         of 400 words or more.   *     Sophisticated parser that can understand (1) complex input commands         including pronouns (IT, HIM, HER, THEM, MY and ITS), and (2) compound         commands separated by AND or THEN or punctuation symbols, and (3)         commands addressed to characters within the game.  Here are a few         examples of commands AGT can handle with ease:              GET THE FLASH LIGHT AND THEN SWITCH IT ON              PUT ON THE CLOAK, THEN EXAMINE IT; READ ITS LABEL              PLACE THE GREEN ROCK AND THE SMALL PEBBLE BEHIND THE TREE              ENTER THE HOUSE; GET ALL; EXIT; SOUTH; SOUTH THEN DOWN              SULU, SET A COURSE FOR ALPHA 14              SCOTTY, BEAM DOWN A TRICORDER AND THE QWERTY MODULE              DROP THE FOOD, THE KEY AND THE BOTTLE THEN UNLOCK THE DOOR WITH                   THE BRASS KEY AND THEN LEAVE   *     Function and cursor keys predefined to input frequently used commands         and move directions.   *     SCRIPT and UNSCRIPT commands to echo game output to printer.   *     Total compatibility with the last version of Generic Adventure Game         System (GAGS version 1.07) and GAGS' large established library of         text adventures.  GAGS was the precursor to AGT.TO LEARN MORE ABOUT THE ADVENTURE GAME TOOLKITLook for a file named AGTBLURB.TXT on this disk or the place/service where yougot this disk.
