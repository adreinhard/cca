Far below you is an activevolcano, from which great gouts of molten lava come surging out, cascadingback down into the depths.  The glowing rock fills the farthest reaches of thecavern with a blood-red glare, giving every- thing an eerie, macabreappearance.  The air is filled with flickering sparks of ash and a heavy smellof brimstone.  The walls are hot to the touch, and the thundering of thevolcano drowns out all other sounds.  Embedded in the jagged roof far overheadare myriad twisted formations composed of pure white alabaster, which scatterthe murky light into sinister apparitions upon the walls.  To one side is adeep gorge, filled with a bizarre chaos of tortured rock which seems to havebeen crafted by the devil himself.  An immense river of fire crashes out fromthe depths of the volcano, burns its way through the gorge, and plummets intoa bottomless pit far off to your left.Across the gorge, the entrance to a valley is dimly visible.  To the right, animmense geyser of blistering steam erupts continuously from a barren island inthe center of a sulfurous lake, which bubbles ominously.  The far right wallis aflame with an incandescence of its own, which lends an additional infernalsplendor to the already hellish scene.  Rising up from the volcano, thesulfurous smoke seems to shape the letters "P L O V E R".  You wonder what itmight mean, but decide it is probably isn't important.A dark, foreboding passage exits to the south.END_ROOM_DESCR#COMMENTFrom the "breath-taking view", the player must wave the rod to cause thewheatstone bridge to appear across the gorge.
