**        This version of Adventure was designed and written by:**        David Platt*        Honeywell Los Angeles Development Center*        5250 West Century Boulevard*        Los Angeles, California   90254*        (213) 216-6232***        This database source file is designed to be used with the*        Honeywell CP-6 operating system's version of the Adventure*        "munger" and "interpreter" programs.  It is an adaptation of*        the database originally implemented on the Xerox CP-V system,*        and with a few minor exceptions it is backwards compatible.*        A full understanding of the functionality of the A-code*        pseudo-instructions can best be acquired by studying both*        the CP-V and CP-6 implementations of the interpreter, since*        highly different methods are used to implement a similar*        target machine in these two versions.  In adapting this*        database and its support programs to a non-Honeywell system,*        it is strongly suggested that a powerful systems*        implementation language be used (i.e., don't try to do*        it in APL (or in BASIC unless you have no other choice)).**        The author can be contacted at the above address / phone*        number, and is willing to answer questions and offer*        (hopefully) sage advice on how to get it working.

Far below you is an          active volcano, from which great gouts of molten lava come surging          out, cascading back down into the depths.  The glowing rock fills the          farthest reaches of the cavern with a blood-red glare, giving every-          thing an eerie, macabre appearance.  The air is filled with flickering          sparks of ash and a heavy smell of brimstone.  The walls are hot to          the touch, and the thundering of the volcano drowns out all other          sounds.  Embedded in the jagged roof far overhead are myriad twisted          formations composed of pure white alabaster, which scatter the murky          light into sinister apparitions upon the walls.  To one side is a deep          gorge, filled with a bizarre chaos of tortured rock which seems to          have been crafted by the devil himself.  An immense river of fire          crashes out from the depths of the volcano, burns its way through the          gorge, and plummets into a bottomless pit far off to your left.         Across the gorge, the entrance to a valley is dimly visible.  To          the right, an immense geyser of blistering steam erupts continuously          from a barren island in the center of a sulfurous lake, which bubbles          ominously.  The far right wall is aflame with an incandescence of its          own, which lends an additional infernal splendor to the already          hellish scene.

All of them are imbued with a         fantastic seeming of life by the shifting and flickering light of         the volcano.  The entire far end of the valley is taken up by an         immense carving of a seated figure;  its exact form cannot be seen         from here due to the uncertainty of the light.PLACE    BY.FIGURE         You're at north end of the Valley of the Stone Faces.        %You are standing at the north end of the Valley of the Stone Faces.         Above you, an incredible bas-relief statue of an immense minotaur         has been carved out of the rock.

It is*        intended as a trash-can place - objects moved to Ylem are*        forever inaccessable (coding convention only - no enforcement*        by the handlers).  Currently Ylem is used as follows:  if*        you cheat the troll out of the nest of golden eggs (as you*        must if you wish to get full score) and then try to bribe*        him with them a second time, he lets them sail into the chasm*        and demands something else;  the eggs are moved to Ylem, and*        the Fee Fie Foe Foo logic will recognize this and refuse to*        fetch them back to the Giant room again.  Ylem is also used*        in the fall-to-a-painful-death logic (label SPLATTER and*        a couple of miscellaneous calls also) so that if you fall from*        someplace and would end up lying dead at some location*        that isn't really defined (the bottom of the chasm,*        in the volcanic gorge, etc) the things you were carrying*        get deposited in an inaccessable location.*         You are in Ylem.         %You are in Ylem (circular file for objects).OBJECT    GRATE         {Grate}         %The grate is locked.         %The grate is open.OBJECT    STEPS         {Steps}OBJECT    DOOR         {Rusty door}         %The way north is barred by a massive, rusty, iron door.         %The way north leads through a massive, rusty, iron door.OBJECT    SNAKE         {Snake}         %A huge green fierce snake bars the way!         %>$< (chased away)OBJECT    FISSURE         {Fissure}         %>$<         %A crystalline bridge now spans the fissure.         %The crystalline bridge has vanished!OBJECT    TABLET         {Stone tablet}         %A massive stone tablet imbedded in the wall reads:          "Congratulations on bringing light into the Dark room!"OBJECT    MIRROR         {Mirror}         %>$<OBJECT    PLANT         {Plant}         %There is a tiny little plant in the pit, murmuring "Water, water, ..."         %The plant spurts into furious growth for a few seconds.         %There is a 12-foot-tall beanstalk stretching up out of the pit,          bellowing "WATER!!

Say "NEWS" to get up-to-date         game details as of 9/18/84. TEXT     NEWSDATA         9/18/84 - A set of maps which describe Colossal Cave may be ordered         from the following address:         /         David Platt        /         c/o Honeywell Information Systems        /         5250 West Century Boulevard        /         Los Angeles, CA  90045          There is no charge for the maps;  however, each request MUST include         a large (legal-sized or better) self-addressed envelope with at least         two first-class stamps.  Requests received without envelopes, or with         insufficient return postage, will be tossed into a bottomless pit and         never heard from again.          The set of maps consists of a two-page map of the main cave, plus         detail maps of the mazes, tunnels, and other complex areas.         The locations of various treasures and tools are given in the main         map... however, the maps do not reveal ways past the cave's obstacles.          1/19/82 - Based on many requests, the SAVE/RESTORE logic has been         modified in a way that makes exploration of dangerous sections of the         cave rather easier.  Three changes are effective:  (1) you need not         wait 30 minutes after SAVE'ing a game to RESTORE it;  (2) when you         have SAVE'd a game, you will have the chance to continue with your         exploration immediately;  (3) when you RESTORE a game, you will have         the option to keep the saved game on disk, and can thus RESTORE it         an unlimited number of times.          A minor bug in the pirate logic has been fixed.          10/18/79 - Several problems have been fixed in this version of         Adventure.  Both the new run unit and the new database file should         be installed at the same time.  (1)  The interpreter trap during         "RESTORE" operations has been fixed.  (2)  The 'vanishing fog' problem         has been corrected.  (3)  If you pour water or oil on the ground, the         ground will remain wet (although you can't get the water or oil back         by mopping up the floor or any such thing).  (4)  Games saved under         previous versions of the database cannot be restored using this         version due to some slight changes in the object status controls.          Suggestions are being entertained for possible additions to the         cave.  If you have any interesting ideas, please write them down         and mail them to Dave Platt, c/o Honeywell, 5250 W. Century Blvd,         Los Angeles CA 90254, or give me a call at (213)216-6232. TEXT     INTRO         Somewhere nearby is Colossal Cave, where others have found fortunes in         treasure and gold, though it is rumored that some who enter are never         seen again.

Most of my vocabulary         describes places and is used to move you there.  To move, try words         like FOREST, BUILDING, DOWNSTREAM, ENTER, EAST, WEST, NORTH, SOUTH,         UP, or DOWN.  I know about a few special objects, like a black rod         hidden in the cave.  These objects can be manipulated using some of         the action words that I know.  Usually you will need to give both the         object and action words (in either order), but sometimes I can infer         the object from the verb alone.  Some objects also imply verbs; in         particular, "INVENTORY" implies "TAKE INVENTORY", which causes me to         give you a list of the things you're carrying (you can say just         "INV" instead of "INVENTORY" if you wish).  The objects have side         effects; for instance, the rod scares the bird.  Usually people having         trouble moving just need to try a few more words.  Usually people         trying unsuccessfully to manipulate an object are attempting something         beyond their (or my!) capabilities and should try a completely         different tack.  To speed the game you can sometimes move long         distances with a single word.  For example, "BUILDING" usually gets         you to the building from anywhere above ground except when lost in the         forest.  Also, note that cave passages turn a lot, and that leaving a         room to the north does not guarantee entering the next from the south.         Good luck! TEXT     CANT.HELP.YOU         Well, you do seem to be having problems, don't you?

You cannot         enter without a key, and there are no keys nearby.  I would recommend         looking elsewhere for the keys.TEXT     INFOREST         The trees of the forest are large hardwood oak and maple, with an         occasional grove of pine or spruce.

To re-start your game at a later         time, start up a new adventure and after I say "You are standing...",         you must say "RESTORE".  You can also name your game by saying         "SUSPEND mine" (and "RESTORE mine") where "mine" is the name that         you wish your suspended name to be known by (1-12 characters).         To see what hours the cave is normally open, say "HOURS".         To see how well you're doing, say "SCORE".  To get full credit for a         treasure, you must have left it safely in the building, though you get         partial credit just for locating it.  You lose points for getting         killed, or for quitting, though the former costs you more.  There are         also points based on how much (if any) of the cave you've managed to         explore; in particular, there is a large bonus just for getting in (to         distinguish the beginners from the rest of the pack), and there are         other ways to determine whether you've been through some of the more         harrowing sections.  If you think you've found all the treasures, just         keep exploring for a while.  If nothing interesting happens, you         haven't found them all yet.  If something interesting *does* happen,         it means you're getting a bonus and have an opportunity to garner many         more points in the master's section.  I may occasionally offer hints         if you seem to be having trouble.  If I do, I'll warn you in advance         how much it will affect your score.  To save paper, you may specify         "BRIEF", which tells me never to repeat the full description of a         place unless you explicitly ask me to by saying "LOOK".  If you         are an experienced adventurer, you may wish to specify "FAST", which         is like "BRIEF" but more so;  in "FAST" mode I will *never* under         any circumstances give the full description of a place.  Finally, if         you are in "BRIEF" or "FAST" modes, you may return to the normal mode         of operation by saying "FULL". TEXT     QUIT.NOW?         Do you indeed wish to quit now?TEXT     NOTHING.VASE         There is nothing here with which to fill the vase.TEXT     SHATTER.VASE         The sudden change in temperature has delicately shattered the vase.TEXT     NO.CAN.FIX         It is beyond your power to do that.TEXT     DUNNO.HOW         I don't know how.TEXT     TOO.FAR.UP         It is too far up for you to reach.TEXT     DWARF.POOF         You killed a little dwarf.

You         are unable to dodge it and it chops you in half.TEXT     OGRE.KILLED         The sword halts in mid-air, twirls like a dervish, and chants several         bars of "Dies Ire" in a rough tenor voice.  It then begins to spin         like a rip-saw blade and flies directly at the ogre, who attempts to         catch it without success;  it strikes him full on the chest.  There is         a brilliant flash of light, a deafening roar and a cloud of oily grey         smoke;  when the smoke clears (and your eyes begin working properly         again) you see that the ogre has vanished.

The         mithril ring in your hand quivers and glows, and a swirling vortex         of white vapor encircles you and protects you from the fumes.  The         bear is not so lucky, though, since the vortex is rather small;  the         noxious gasses choke it and it staggers off of the side of the arch         and plummets into the gorge below. TEXT     GHOST.BANG         As you reach the center of the bridge, a ghostly figure appears in         front of you.  He (?) stands at least eight feet tall, and has the         lower body of an enormous snake, six arms, and an angry expression on         his face.  "You'll not have my sceptre that easily!" he cries, and         makes a complex magical gesture with his lower right arm.  There is a         brilliant flash of light and a vicious >crack<, and the bridge cracks         and plummets into the gorge.TEXT     NO.KEYHOLE         The door to the safe has no keyhole, dial, or handle - I can't figure         out how to open it!TEXT     ALREADY.OPEN         The # is already open!TEXT     IT.IS.MELTED         The door to the safe seems to be fused shut - I can't open it.TEXT     ALREADY.SHUT         The # is already closed!TEXT     SAFE.SHUTS         >screeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeech<        /                                              >ker-CHUNK!<          The safe is now closed.TEXT     SAFE.OPENS         >ker-THUNK<        /            >screeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeech<          The (somewhat rusty) safe is now open.TEXT     WHISPER         You pluck the sceptre from the skeleton's bony hand.
