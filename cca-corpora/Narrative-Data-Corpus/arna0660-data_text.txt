*        Now for the place descriptions.*PLACE    +ROAD         You're at end of road again.        %You are standing at the end of a road before a small brick         building. Around you is a forest. A small stream flows out of         the building and down a gully and a wide path leads northwest.PLACE    +HILL         You're at hill in road.        %You have walked up a hill, still in the forest. To the north lies a         snow-capped mountain range with peaks that rise into the sky. To the         south, partly obscured by a thin haze, lies a white fortress with         seven towers. Beyond the fortress, shimmering in the sun, there         sparkles a great expanse of water. To the east the road runs down the         hill towards a small building visible in the distance. The way west         is barred by a low wooden gate. A notice on the gate reads        =               "PRIVATE PROPERTY - NO ADMITTANCE"        =                "TRESPASSERS WILL BE PERSECUTED"PLACE    +RAVINE         You're at the east end of the ravine.        %You are standing on a wide path at the bottom of a damp and overgrown         ravine.

The path, in places almost submerged by encroaching ferns,         runs east and northwest.**        Note that the definitions of the view and the building MUST follow*        one another, else the player will never get the full credit for the*        starstone.*PLACE    STUPENDOUS.VIEW         You're at the magnificent view.        %You are on a broad patch of sunlit grass, enclosed by steep chalk banks         lined with flowering gorse bushes and topped with a crowded phalanx of         firs. In the middle of the grass is a flattened, trampled looking area         with the old remains of a fire in the centre. A semicircular indentation         in the ashes could be easily taken for a heelprint, if it were         not so large. A narrow ravine leads southeast. To the west the banks         and the grass suddenly give way to a sheer cliff drop of about a         thousand feet. The view is quite magnificent: far beneath you the sea         sparkles in the sun, white headed rollers break on a golden beach and         an island is floating in haze on the horizon, seemingly suspended         between the sea and the sky.PLACE    +BUILDING, HOUSE   {synonym for compatibility with Multics}         You're inside building.        %You are inside a building, a well house for a large spring.PLACE    +VALLEY         You're in valley.        %You are in a valley in the forest beside a stream tumbling along a         rocky bed.PLACE    +SLIT         You're at [slit/gap] in streambed.        %At your feet all the water of the stream splashes into         a five-[inch slit/foot gap] in the rock.

A small NW path seems to widen after a short         distance. An extremely tight tunnel leads east. It looks like a very         tight squeeze. An eerie light can be seen at the other end.PLACE    +PLOVER         You're in Plover room.        %You're in a small chamber lit by an eerie green light.

The floor and         walls are littered with bits of shells imbedded in the stone. A         shallow passage proceeds downward, and a somewhat steeper one         leads up. A low hands and knees passage enters from the south.PLACE    RAGGED.CORRIDOR         You are in a long sloping corridor with ragged sharp walls.        %You are in a long sloping corridor with ragged sharp walls.PLACE    CULDESAC         You are in a cul-de-sac about eight feet across.        %You are in a cul-de-sac about eight feet across.PLACE    +ANTEROOM         You're in anteroom.        %You are in an anteroom leading to a large passage to the east.

Passages lead off in *all* directions.PLACE    MIRROR.CANYON         You're in mirror canyon.        %You are in a north/south canyon about 25 feet across. The floor is         covered by white mist seeping in from the north. The walls extend         upward for well over 100 feet. Suspended from some unseen point far         above you, an enormous two-sided mirror is hanging parallel to and         midway between the canyon walls. (The mirror is obviously provided for         the use of the dwarves, who as you know, are extremely vain.) A small         window can be seen in either wall, some fifty feet up.PLACE    TOP.OF.STALACTITE         You're at top of stalactite.        %A large stalactite extends from the roof and almost reaches the floor         below.

A thick         cloud of white mist fills the room, rising from the surface of the         water and drifting rapidly upwards. The lake is fed by a stream, which         tumbles out of a hole in the wall about 10 feet overhead and splashes         noisily into the water near the reservoir's northern wall. A         dimly-seen passage exits through the northern wall, but you can't get         across the water to get to it. Another passage leads south from here         and a causeway is dimly visible in the gloom to the west.PLACE    RESERVOIR.NORTH         You are at the northern end of the reservoir.        %You are at the northern end of a large underground reservoir. Across         the water to the south, a dark passage is visible. Another passage         leads north from here.

Mist drifts into the         chamber from a passage entering from the south and evaporates in the         heat. Another passage leads out to the northeast.PLACE    +BALCONY         You're on balcony above treasure chamber.        %You are in a high balcony carved out of solid rock overlooking a large,         bare chamber lit by dozens of flickering torches. A rushing stream         pours into the chamber through a five-foot gap in the east wall and         drains into a large pool along the north side of the chamber. A small         plaque riveted to the edge of the balcony reads,        "You are looking at         the Witt Company's main treasure room, constructed by the famous         architect Ralph Witt in 4004 B.C., and dedicated to the proposition         that all adventurers are created equal (although some are more equal         than others). NO ADMITTANCE VIA THIS ENTRANCE!"         A small, dark tunnel leads out to the west.PLACE    +NOWHERE         You are in the middle of a gray, misty nowhere.        %You are in the middle of a gray, misty nowhere.

A faint rumbling noise can be         heard in the distance.PLACE    +FORK         You're at fork in path.        %The path forks here. The left fork leads northeast. A dull rumbling         seems to get louder in that direction. The right fork leads southeast         down a gentle slope. The main corridor enters from the west.PLACE    WARMJUNCTN         You're at junction with warm walls.        %The walls are quite warm here. From the north can be heard a steady         roar, so loud that the entire cave seems to be trembling. Another         passage leads south, and a low crawl goes east.PLACE    +BREATHTAKER         You're at breath-taking view.        %You are on the edge of a breath-taking view. Far below you is an         active volcano, from which great gouts of molten lava come surging out,         cascading back down into the depths. The glowing rock fills the         farthest reaches of the cavern with a blood-red glare, giving every-         thing an eerie, macabre appearance. The air is filled with flickering         sparks of ash and a heavy smell of brimstone. The walls are hot to the         touch, and the thundering of the volcano drowns out all other         sounds. Embedded in the jagged roof far overhead are myriad         twisted formations composed of pure white alabaster, which scatter         the murky light into sinister apparitions upon the walls. To         one side is a deep gorge, filled with a bizarre chaos of tortured         rock which seems to have been crafted by the devil himself. An         immense river of fire crashes out from the depths of the volcano,         burns its way through the gorge, and plummets into a bottomless         pit far off to your left. Across the gorge, the entrance to a         valley is dimly visible. To the right, an enormous geyser of         blistering steam erupts continuously from a barren island in the         center of a sulfurous lake, which bubbles ominously. The far right         wall is aflame with an incandescence of its own, which lends an         additional infernal splendor to the already hellish scene. A dark,         foreboding passage exits to the south.PLACE    +FACES         You're at the south end of the Valley of the Stone Faces.        %You are standing at the southern end of a long valley illuminated by         flickering red light from the volcanic gorge behind you. Carved into         the walls of the valley is an incredible series of stone faces. Some         of them look down into the valley with expressions of benevolence that         would credit a saint; others glare with a malice that makes the heart         grow faint. All of them are imbued with a fantastic seeming of life by         the shifting and flickering light of the volcano. The entire far end         of the valley is taken up by an immense carving of a seated figure;         its exact form cannot be seen from here due to the uncertainty of the         light.PLACE    BY.FIGURE         You're at north end of the Valley of the Stone Faces.        %You are standing at the north end of the Valley of the Stone         Faces. Above you, an incredible bas-relief statue of an immense         minotaur has been carved out of the rock. At least sixty feet         high, it sits gazing down at you with a faint but definite         expression of amusement. Between its feet and the floor is a         rock wall about ten feet high which extends across the entire         north end of the valley.PLACE    PLAIN.1         You're at south end of fog-filled room.        %You are standing at the southern end of what appears to be a large room         filled with multicolored fog. The sides and far end of the room cannot         be seen due to the thickness of the fog - it's a real pea-souper (even         to the color in places!). A passage leads back to the south; a dull         rumbling sound issues from the passage.PLACE    PLAIN.2         >$< {Described by resident object FOG}PLACE    PLAIN.3         You're in foggy room by cairn of rocks.        %You are standing in a fog-filled room next to a tall cairn of glowing         rocks.

The nest of golden eggs*        ends up here the first time you give it to the troll*        and may be fetched back to the Giant room with the*        Fee Fie Foe Foo sequence;  the second time you try to*        give it to the troll it ends up in Ylem (q.v.) and*        can't be gotten back. The Oyster starts out here and*        is swapped with the Clam when you succeed in opening the*        clam with the trident. Needless to say, there is no*        way that the adventurer should be able to get to Limbo*        (unless he is a wizard using the master-mode commands)*        since he could do all kinds of nasty things here (get the*        batteries without paying the coins, get the rug without*        first killing the dragon, get the food back after feeding*        the bear, move the clam to the house, etc.)  Very nasty!*         You are in Limbo.        %You are in Limbo, a place outside the game, full of things awaiting         their incarnation in the game. There are also shadowy presences         lurking about, mostly invisible to the eye, with no hope of ever         leaving this strange place. The only exit is OUT.PLACE    +YLEM**        Ylem must be the last place defined (following Limbo). It is*        intended as a trash-can place - objects moved to Ylem are*        forever inaccessable (coding convention only - no enforcement*        by the handlers). Ylem is also used in the fall-to-a-painful-death*        logic (label SPLATTER and a couple of miscellaneous calls also)*        so that if you fall from someplace and would end up lying dead at*        some location that isn't really defined (the bottom of the chasm,*        in the volcanic gorge, etc) the things you were carrying get*        deposited here.*         You are in Ylem.        %You are in Ylem, the final resting place of objects and beings in         Adventure4. Naturally enough, there are no exits. You knew how to         teleport in here, so you should know how to teleport out again.TEXT     SOK!TEXT     BLANKTEXT     OK!         Ok.FRAGMENT INSTRUCTIONS?         Would you like instructions?TEXT     HISTORY.DATA         The following is a brief history of this game.        =1.

In         illo tempore, my friend, in "time before time"...TEXT     ORIENTAL.DRAWING         It's just ordinary ancient oriental cave drawings of no conceivable         interest to a mere adventurer like you.TEXT     INTRO         Somewhere nearby is Colossal Cave, where others have found fortunes in         treasure and gold, though it is rumoured that some who enter are never         seen again. Magic is said to work in the cave.         I will be your eyes and hands. My understanding of human language is         limited to very simple sentences, consisting essentially of just a         verb, followed, if appropriate, by a noun (type INFO for more         information). Most words I know can be abbreviated to the least         unambiguous length - in practice usually three or four characters.         Only magic words cannot be abbreviated at all, for obvious reasons.         To see a list of words I know, type VOCABULARY (or just VOC).         Should you get stuck, typing HELP may result in some obscure hints.         Other generally useful commands are LOOK, EXAMINE (e.g. EXAMINE LAMP),         SAVE, RESTORE and QUIT. For news, if any, type NEWS.         If you have already played an earlier version of Adventure, you may         want to know where the differences are to be found, so that you don't         waste your time looking for them.TEXT     DWARF.BLOCKS         A little dwarf with a big knife blocks your way.TEXT     FIRST.DWARF         A little dwarf just walked around a corner, saw you, threw a little axe         at you which missed, cursed, and ran away.         There is a little axe here.TEXT     KNIVES.THROWN         [/One/#] nasty sharp kni[/fe is/ves are] thrown at you!TEXT     KNIVES.MISS         [/It misses/They miss] you!TEXT     KNIVES.GOT.YOU         [/It/One of them] gets you!TEXT     FIRST.DEFLECTOR         Your magic ring shoots out a bolt of lightning that splinters         the [/knife/knives] into dust before [/it/they] can reach you!TEXT         A glowing disk of black fire jumps out of your magic ring and swallows         the hurtling [/knife/knives] before [/it/they] can harm you!TEXT         [/A ball/Balls] of searing flame burst[/s/] out of your magic ring,         rebound[/s/] off of the ground, and vaporize[/s/] the          kni[/fe/ves] before [/it/they] can reach you.TEXT     LAST.DEFLECTOR         Your magic ring emits a blast of some strange magical energy that         knocks the kni[/fe/ves] aside!TEXT     HOLLOW.VOICE         A hollow voice says "Plugh".TEXT     NO.CAN.GO         I'm sorry, but there's no way you can go # from here.TEXT         There is no way for you to go #.TEXT         You cannot go #.TEXT         There's no exit # from here.TEXT         No exit # from here, I am afraid.TEXT     OG.NAC.ON         Going # is not possible from here.

I can't say I am really surprised; them         dwarves have quite a reputation for hand to hand fighting.FRAGMENT WITH.WHAT?         With your bare hands??TEXT     OLDFASHIONED.MAGIC         Good try, but that's a worn out, oldfashioned magic word.TEXT     HELP.DATA         Imagine that you are somewhere else (far, far away, in a strange land         of magic and wonder). As your guide, I will describe to you your         surroundings while you tell me what you want to do next. For example,         to move, try words like ENTER (and EXIT), EAST (or E for short), NORTH         (or N), SOUTHWEST (or SW), UP (or U) etc. (You don't have to say         GO EAST etc., just the direction will do). Words like DOWNSTREAM,         CLIMB, CROSS may also come handy. Some other useful commands         are INVENTORY (or I), LOOK (or L, or EXAMINE, or X), SCORE, INFO,         VOCABULARY etc.         In addition to the special abbreviations (like I for Inventory), all         words, other than magic ones, can be abbreviated to the shortest         unambiguous length. READ, for instance, can be shortened to REA but         not RE, since it would clash with REMOVE. Generally you will find that         most words abbreviate to three or four characters.         Objects can be manipulated using some of the verbs that I know.         Usually you have to give both the object and the verb (in either         order), but sometimes I can infer the object from the verb alone - e.g.         both LIGHT (or ON) and EXTINGUISH (or OFF) imply LAMP. Some objects         have side-effects; for instance, rods scare birds.TEXT     HELP.DATA.END         Remember that I only understand commands of one or two words. Novice         players often forget that, for example, THROW AXE AT DWARF is not         going to do anything different from what THROW AXE would achieve.         Usually people trying unsuccessfully to manipulate an object are         attempting something beyond their (or my) capabilities and should try         a completely different tack.         To speed up the game you can sometimes move long distances with a         single word. For example BUILDING usually gets you to the building         from most places above ground except when lost in the forest. Also,         note that cave passages turn a lot, and that leaving a room to the         north does not guarantee entering the next from the south.         Finally, it is worth remembering that I mostly mean just what I say.         On the other hand, do not assume that everything to be seen or found         in the Colossal Cave has any particular purpose, even though most         things and beings do have one (or more).        +                                             Good luck!TEXT     CANT.HELP.YOU         Well, you do seem to be having problems, don't you?

There is quite a bit of         undergrowth, largely birch and ash saplings as well as nondescript         bushes of various sorts.

(ADVENTURE4 - type HISTORY for a brief summary of its         development). The game now has well over 300 locations and an         untold treasure of snide remarks (over 200Kb of text altogether).         ADVENTURE4 accepts only simple verb/noun commands. It is,         however, possible to specify more than one object with a single         verb. For instance GET KEYS AND LAMP will pick up both, even         though it still counts as two turns. Commas can be used in place         of ANDs to save typing. If you are really lazy, GET ALL and DROP         ALL also work, again taking the appropriate number of turns.         Certain words (A, AN, THAT, THE, THIS and TO) are ignored by the         parser, making GET THE AXE a legal command. Some verbs (e.g.         GET) do not need a noun, provided only one object is present to         which the verb can be applied.         Commands can be chained together with full stops or with         semicolons (e.g. THROW AXE.GET AXE). The special verb AGAIN can         be used to repeat the previous command line, or, when embedded in         a longer command sequence, the previous command in the sequence.TEXT         All words can be abbreviated to the shortest unambiguous length.         In addition, the usual special abbreviations exist (E for EAST,         SE for SOUTHEAST, U for UP...). Some additional abbreviations         are G or T for GET (or TAKE), DR or R for DROP (or RELEASE), X         for EXAMINE (or LOOK), TH for THROW and I for INVENTORY.         If you want to end your adventure early, say Q (or QUIT). To         suspend your adventure such that you can continue later, say SAVE         \<name\> (or PAUSE or SUSPEND), where \<name\> is the name you wish         this particular save-image to be known by (it must be a single         word of between 1 and 12 characters). To re-start your game at a         later time, start up a new one and say RESTORE \<name\>. If you         forget to specify the name, the program will prompt you for it.         To see how well you're doing, say SCORE. To get full credit for         a treasure, you must have left it safely in the building, though         you get partial credit just for locating it. There are also         points based on your achievements; in particular, there is a         large bonus just for getting in (to distinguish the beginners         from the rest of the pack), and there are other ways to determine         whether you've been through some of the more harrowing sections.TEXT         You lose points for getting killed, or for quitting, though the         former costs you more.         If you think you've got all the treasures in the building, just         keep exploring the cave for a while. If nothing interesting         happens, you haven't collected them all yet. If something         interesting *does* happen, it means you're getting a bonus and         have an opportunity to garner many more points in the master's         section.         Do remember to examine things. It is not essential to do so, but         sometimes my responses may suggest particular properties or         limitations of objects you find in the cave. If you seem to be         having trouble, I may occasionally offer hints. If I do, I'll         warn you in advance how much it will affect your score.         Also remember that some descriptions contain details which are         mere windowdressing. You can usually tell if this is the case by         trying words I use in describing present features. If I don't         know the words or am obviously misunderstanding them, it is safe         to assume that such features cannot be in fact manipulated         and that you would be wasting your time trying to do so.TEXT     INFO.LAST         Finally, I will not normally repeat the full description of a         place after the first time unless you explicitly ask me to by         saying LOOK. You can instruct me always to give the full         description by typing VERBOSE. On the other hand, if you are an         experienced adventurer, you may wish to suppress long         descriptions altogether by specifying TERSE. In the TERSE mode I         will never under any circumstances give the full description of a         place. You can always revert to the normal mode of operation by         saying NORMAL.FRAGMENT MORE?         Would you like me to continue?FRAGMENT WANT.TO.QUIT?         Do you really wish to quit now?TEXT     NO.VASE.FILLER         There is nothing here with which to fill the vase.TEXT     VASE.SHATTERS         The sudden change in temperature has delicately shattered the vase.TEXT     NO.CAN.FIX         It is beyond your power to do that.TEXT     DUNNO.HOW         I don't know how.TEXT     TOO.FAR.UP         It is too far up for you to reach.TEXT     DWARF.POOF         You killed a little dwarf.

This might have worked         with dwarves, but as should be obvious even to a hedgehog, ogrish         arms are somewhat longer and stronger.TEXT     OGRE.HALVES.YOU         The ogre casually catches the # in mid-air, braces his feet, winds up         and throws the # straight back at you with incredible force.

The         mithril ring on your finger quivers and glows, and a swirling vortex         of white vapor encircles you and protects you from the fumes. The bear         is not so lucky, though, since the vortex is rather small; the noxious         gasses choke it and it staggers off of the side of the arch and         plummets into the gorge below.TEXT     GHOST.BANG         As you reach the center of the bridge, a ghostly figure appears in         front of you.

In         some other places, it's "no" for an obvious reason. Right here, the         answer is "no" but the reason isn't so obvious.

I WOULD REWARD YOU FOR THIS, MORTAL, BUT IT HAS BEEN         THREE THOUSAND YEARS SINCE I HAD A SOLID MEAL, AND I'M NOT GOING TO         STAND HERE CHATTERING WHEN I COULD BE OUT EATING A SIX-INCH SIRLOIN         STEAK.

With that, he somewhat rudely explodes back into         smoke and drifts quickly out of sight.TEXT     DJINN.ADVICE         The pentagram's magical barrier sparks fitfully and goes down. The         Djinn stretches gratefully and smiles at you. "AGAIN, MY THANKS," he         says. "MY ADVICE TO YOU WILL TAKE THE FORM OF A HISTORY LESSON. WHEN         RALPH WITT, THE ARCHITECT AND CONSTRUCTOR OF THIS CAVE, WAS VERY YOUNG,         HE BECAME VERY INCENSED THAT HIS NAME WAS AT THE END OF THE ALPHABET.         HE FELT (FOR SOME REASON) THAT THE LETTER W BELONGED NEAR THE BEGINNING         OF THE ALPHABET, AND THAT ALL OF THOSE "UPSTART LETTERS WHICH UNFAIRLY         USURPED THE BEST PLACES" SHOULD BE FORCED INTO EXILE AT THE END OF THE         ALPHABET.

As you turn towards it, an incredible figure         rolls into the light of your lamp. It stands about five feet high on a         wheeled metal pedestal, and has a globular light-filled head,         accordion-pleated metal arms, and a cylindrical body the size of an oil         drum with a plastic panel on the front.

DANGER!" at         the top of its not inconsiderable voice. It rolls on out of sight, and         moments later there is an immense flash of light and a tremendous blast         of sparks and smoke. When the air clears, you find that no trace         remains of the strange apparition.TEXT         With a sudden gust of air, a large cave bat flutters into view, flies         around your head several times, squeaks with disgust, and flutters on         out of sight.TEXT         Suddenly, the ground quivers underfoot; a dull rumbling sound resounds         from the rock around you, and in the distance you can hear the crash of         falling rock.

As you         turn towards the sound, a nine-foot cyclops ambles into the light of         your lamp. The cyclops is dressed in a three-piece suit of worsted         wool, and is wearing a black silk top-hat and cowboy boots and is         carrying an ebony walking-stick. It catches sight of you and stops,         seeming frozen in its tracks, with its bloodshot eye bulging in         amazement and its fang-filled jaw drooping with shock. After staring         at you in incredulous disbelief for a few moments, it reaches into the         pocket of its vest and pulls out a small plastic bag filled with a         leafy green substance, and examines it carefully. "It must be worth         eighty pazools an ounce after all" mumbles the cyclops, who casts one         final look at you, shudders, and staggers away out of sight.TEXT         From somewhere in the distance comes a heart-wrenching scream of mortal         terror!

Subdued crunching         and slurping sounds can be heard for a minute or so, and then silence         falls.TEXT         All of the sudden, into the light of your lamp walks a procession of         little men in green suits and green top hats.

Sombre chords of a         funeral march seem to be hovering in the air on the verge of         audibility, but as you strain your ears, the only sound you can hear is         the shuffling of little feet. The procession passes by you, without in         any way acknowledging your presence, and disappears round a corner.TEXT         A sepulchral voice suddenly reverberates through the cave:         "Ralph Witt to the Main Office please!

As         you cower back in disgust and horror, the figure halts, examines you         through eyes resembling wet pebbles, and whispers "Peace, man!" in a         voice like wind rustling through dead trees.

A small moon hangs almost         directly overhead, where the indigo sky darkens into near blackness.TEXT     LAST.LANDSCAPE         _The dark green sky is filled with a delicate tracery of feathery         silver clouds tinged with green. The silver ocean, stretching all the         way to the west horizon, is mirror-smooth. There is a sharp chill in         the still air. Your breath condenses into clouds of mist which slowly         drift up along the face of the cliff. The dark mouth of a lava tube         leads east.TEXT     GOT.STARSTONE         Well, I'll try, but it may not be actually here, you know.

"Oh no you don't!..." he says and points at the chalice         which crumples to dust in your hands. The creature gives you a sardonic         salute, screws its tail into a tight spiral and disappears in a dazzling         shower of multicoloured sparks.TEXT     BUZZ.OFF         "OI!" says the giant, "YOU'VE HAD YOUR REWARD.

Be serious!TEXT     CHASE.GIANT         "OI!..." begins the giant in an unfriendly tone of voice, but before         he can get any further, a large pinkish cloud condenses nearby.         A mouth and a pair of dark eyes shape themselves in the cloud and         the familiar deep voice booms out: "IT COMES TO ME, OH MORTAL,         THAT I HAD FORGOTTEN TO MENTION ONE PROPERTY OF THE MAGIC WORD OF         MY AUNT'S. SHE USED TO CLAIM, ALWAYS WITH A CHUCKLE, THAT IT SHOULD         HAVE A MOST INTERESTING EFFECT UPON GIANTS..."         At these words the giant visibly blanches and hurriedly begins to         collect his possessions, muttering anxiously "OUKAY...

Having collected the lot into a large untidy         bundle he sticks the crate of champagne under his arm and, with a         nasty glance in the djinn's direction, climbs (I would not have         believed it possible!) over the edge of the enclosure and disappears         from the view.

The settling dust reveals a dark hole leading northeast.         When the air is finally clear, a snow-white golden-horned unicorn         walks out of the hole and, gracefully picking its way through the         heaps of rubble, calmly approaches you.TEXT     NO.FUTURE.IN.DEBRIS         Plenty of it about, but somehow I don't think there is much future         in it.TEXT     ALREADY.HAD.ONE         You already had one!

I've included here some words which are not verbs in         the strict grammatical meaning of the word, but which are nonetheless         acted upon as such (e.g. 'terse').         Verbs:         /       blast, break, brief, change, climb, close (lock), cross, cut,        /       dig, drink, drop (DR, free), eat, enter (in), exit (out),        /       extinguish (off), feed, fill, go (walk, run), get (G, take, T),        /       help (?), history, hit, hoot, info, inventory (I), jump, kill,        /       lift, light (on), listen, look (L, examine, X), news, open        /       (unlock), play, pour, quit (Q), read, reflect, remove, rest,        /       restore, retreat (back), ride, rub (polish), save, say, score        /       (SC), scry, tame (placate), terse, throw (TH), translate,        /       verbose, vocabulary, wash, wave (swing), wear.TEXT         Next come nouns. These describe things and beings you can sensibly         refer to and may (or may not) be able to manipulate.         Nouns:         /       axe, bag, basilisk, batteries, beads, bear, bird, bones,        /       bottle, bracelet, cage, chain, chalice, chasm, chest        /       (treasure), clam, coins, crown, crucifix, curtains, diamonds,        /       dinghy, djinn, documents, door, drachma, dragon, drain,        /       drawings, dung, dwarf (dwarves), eggs (nest), emerald, fish,        /       flask, fog, food, gate, giant, goblins, gold (nugget), gong,        /       grate, grill, helmet, horn, inscription, jewelry, keys, lamp,        /       machine (vending), magazine (Spelunker), mirror, mist,        /       mushroom, notice, ogre, oil, opals (casket), orb (globe), owl,        /       pearl, pillow, pirate, plant (beanstalk), plaque, plate,        /       portcullis, pottery (shards), pyramid, rags, rat, ring, rod,        /       rope, rug, safe, sapphire, sceptre, sculpture, silver (bars),        /       skeleton, slime, snake, spices, spider, spoon, spyglass,        /       stalactite, starstone, statue, steps, sword, tablet, teeth,        /       throne, tortoise, tree, trident, troll, tusk, unicorn, vase,        /       vial, water, web, yacht.TEXT     VOCAB.LAST         Finally, the directions and some travel options.         Directions:         /            north (N), northeast (NE), east (E), southeast (SE),        /            south (S), southwest (SW), west (W), northwest (NW),        /            up (U) and down (D), downstream, upstream.         Travel options are special words, like BUILDING, which allow you         to travel some distance in one move. Naturally, they only work in         a few restricted places. Just where, you will have to discover for         yourself.         Travel options:         /                barren, bedquilt, building, depression, fork, pit,        /                secret, view, ...         I am myself unsure of the complete list.

Not all expansions         are important (though most definitely are) and some may be less than         immediately obvious. You will also find other changes and additions here         and there, but this lot should be quite sufficient to get you going.         If you only know the original Adventure, you should explore around the         Antechamber, the Reservoir, the South Side Chamber, the Breathtaking         View, the Giant Room, the Hall of the Mountain King, the Arched Hall         and around the building.         Adventure II devotees should visit the Breathtaking View, the Giant         Room, the Hall of the Mountain King, the Arched Hall and Above Chapel.         Exploring above ground is also recommended.TEXT     EXPANSIONS.END         Adventure 550 (or Adventure3) players will find changes in the South         Side Chamber, the Anteroom, the Reservoir, the Lava Tube and above         ground. There are also noteworthy changes (though no actual expansion)         in the Toolroom and in the Catacombs.         All players should read carefully through the text provided by INFO and         the 'vanilla flavoured' HELP.

From behind it you can hear intermittent         buzzing, hissing and whirring noises, occasionally accompanied by         showers of sparks, dimly visible through the somewhat transparent         cover.

Curiously enough, while there is plenty of dust all around,         none has accumulated in the niche itself.TEXT     WELL.NO.CLIMB         You clamber up the sides of the well and upon reaching the top find a         stone slab blocking your ascent. You give the slab a push and it         refuses to budge. You push some more, but it is no use.
