0       You are in Ylem (circular file for objects).  GLITCH!1       You are standing at the end of a road before a small brick building.1       Around you is a forest.  A small stream flows out of the building and1       down a gully.2       You have walked up a hill, still in the forest.  The road slopes down2       to the east and the north.  There is a building in the distance to the2       east, and what appears to be a hay-field in the north.3       You are inside a building, a well house for a large spring.4       You are in a valley in the forest beside a stream tumbling along a4       rocky bed.5       You are in an open forest, with a deep valley to one side.6       You are in an open forest, near both a valley and a road.7       At your feet all the water of the stream splashes into a 2-inch slit7       in the rock.  Downstream the streambed is bare rock.8       You are in a 20-foot depression floored with bare dirt.  Set into the8       dirt is a strong steel grate mounted in concrete.  A dry streambed8       leads into the depression.9       You are in a small chamber beneath a 3x3 steel grate to the surface.9       A low crawl over cobbles leads inward to the west.10      You are crawling over cobbles in a low passage.  There is a dim light10      at the east end of the passage.11      You are in a debris room filled with stuff washed in from the surface.11      A low wide passage with cobbles becomes plugged with mud and debris11      here, but an awkward canyon leads upward and west.  A note on the wall11      says "Magic word XYZZY".12      You are in an awkward sloping east-west canyon.13      You are in a splendid chamber thirty feet high.  The walls are frozen13      rivers of orange stone.  An awkward canyon and a good passage exit13      from the east and west sides of the chamber.14      At your feet is a small pit breathing traces of white mist.  An east14      passage ends here except for a small crack leading on.15      You are at one end of a vast hall stretching forward out of sight to15      the west.  There are small passages to the north and south, and a15      small crack leading east.  Nearby, a wide stone staircase leads15      downward.  The hall is filled with wisps of white mist swaying to15      and fro almost as if alive.  A cold wind blows up the staircase.15      There is a passage at the top of a dome behind you.16      You are on the east bank of a fissure slicing clear across the hall.16      The mist is quite thick here, and the fissure is too wide to jump.17      You are on the west side of the fissure in the Hall of Mists.18      This is a low room with a crude note on the wall.  The note says,18      "You won't get it up the steps".19      You are in the Hall of the Mountain King, with passages off in all19      directions.20      You are at the west end of the Twopit room.  There is a large hole in20      the wall above the pit at this end of the room.21      You are at the east end of the Twopit room.  The floor here is21      littered with thin rock slabs, which make it easy to descend the pits.21      There is a path here bypassing the pits to connect passages from east21      and west.  There are holes all over, but the only big one is on the21      wall directly over the west pit where you can't get to it.22      You are at the bottom of the eastern pit in the Twopit room.22      There is a small pool of oil in one corner of the pit.23      You are at the bottom of the western pit in the Twopit room.  There is23      a large hole in the wall about 25 feet above you.24      You are in a low N-S passage at a hole in the floor.  The hole goes24      down to an E-W passage.25      You are in the south side chamber.26      You are in the west side chamber of the Hall of the Mountain King.26      A passage continues west and up here.27      You are in a large room, with a passage to the south, a passage to the27      west, and a wall of broken rock to the east.  There is a large "Y2" on27      a rock in the room's center.28      You are in a jumble of rock, with cracks everywhere.29      You're at a low window overlooking a huge pit, which extends up out of29      sight.  A floor is indistinctly visible over 50 feet below.  Traces of29      white mist cover the floor of the pit, becoming thicker to the right.29      Marks in the dust around the window would seem to indicate that29      someone has been here recently.  Directly across the pit from you and29      25 feet away there is a similiar window looking into a lighted room. A29      shadowy figure can be seen there peering back at you.30      You're at a low window overlooking a huge pit, which extends up out of30      sight.  A floor is indistinctly visible over 50 feet below.  Traces of30      white mist cover the floor of the pit, becoming thicker to the left.30      Marks in the dust around the window would seem to indicate that30      someone has been here recently.  Directly across the pit from you and30      25 feet away there is a similiar window looking into a lighted room. A30      shadowy figure can be seen there peering back at you.31      You are in a dirty broken passage.  To the east is a crawl.  To the31      west is a large passage.  Above you is a hole to another passage.32      You are on the brink of a small clean climbable pit.  A crawl leads32      west.33      You are at the bottom of a small pit with a little stream, which33      enters and exits through tiny slits.34      You are in a large room full of dusty rocks.  There is a big hole in34      the floor.  There are cracks everywhere, and a passage leading east.35      You are at the west end of the Hall of Mists.  A low wide crawl35      continues west and another goes north.  To the south is a little35      passage 6 feet off the floor.36      You are in a maze of twisty little passages, all alike.37      You are in a maze of twisty little passages, all alike.38      You are in a maze of twisty little passages, all alike.39      You are in a maze of twisty little passages, all alike.40      Dead end.41      Dead end.42      You are in a maze of twisty little passages, all alike.43      Dead end.44      You are in a maze of twisty little passages, all alike.45      You are in a maze of twisty little passages, all alike.46      You are in a maze of twisty little passages, all alike.47      You are in a maze of twisty little passages, all alike.48      Dead end.49      You are in a maze of twisty little passages, all alike.50      Dead end.51      You are on the brink of a thirty foot pit with a massive orange column51      down one wall.  You could climb down here but you could not get back51      up.  The maze continues at this level.52      Dead end.53      You are in a maze of twisty little passages, all alike.54      Dead end.55      Dead end.56      You are in a maze of twisty little passages, all alike.57      You are in a maze of twisty little passages, all alike.58      Dead end.59      Dead end.60      You are in a maze of twisty little passages, all alike.61      Dead end.62      You are at the east end of a very long hall apparently without side62      chambers.  To the east a low wide crawl slants up.  To the north a62      round two foot hole slants down.63      You are at the west end of a long featureless hall.  The hall63      joins up with a narrow north-south passage.64      You are at a crossover of a high N-S passage and a low E-W one.65      Dead end passage.  Scratched on a rock is the message, "Stand where65      the statue gazes, and make use of the proper tool."66      You are at a complex junction.  A low hands and knees passage from the66      north joins a higher crawl from the east to make a walking passage66      going west.  There is a large room above.  The air is damp here.67      You are in Bedquilt, a long east-west passage with holes everywhere.67      To explore at random select NORTH, SOUTH, UP or DOWN.68      You are in a room whose walls represent Swiss cheese.  Obvious passages68      go west, east, NE and NW.  Part of the room is occupied by a large68      bedrock block.69      You are in a large low circular chamber whose floor is an immense slab69      fallen from the ceiling (Slab room).  East and west there once were69      large passages, but they are now filled with boulders.  Low small69      passages go north and south, and the south one quickly bends west69      around the boulders.70      You are in a secret N-S canyon above a large room.71      You are in a secret N-S canyon above a sizable passage.72      You are in a secret canyon at a junction of three canyons, bearing72      north, south and SE.  The north one is as tall as the other two72      combined.73      You are in a large low room.  Crawls lead north, SE and SW.74      Dead end crawl.75      You are in a secret canyon which runs E-W.  It crosses over a very75      tight canyon 15 feet below.  If you go down, you may not be able to75      get back up.76      You are at a wide place in a very tight N-S canyon.77      The canyon becomes too tight to go further south.78      You are in a tall E-W canyon.  A low tight crawl goes 3 feet north and78      seems to open up.79      The canyon runs in to a mass of boulders - dead end.  Scratched on79      one of the boulders are the words, "Kreskin was here".80      You are in a long, narrow corridor stretching out of sight to the80      west.  At the eastern end is a hole through which you can see a80      profusion of leaves.81      You are at the top of a steep incline above a large room.  You could81      climb down here, but you would not be able to climb up.  There is a81      passage leading back to the north.82      You are in the Giant room.  The ceiling here is too high up for your82      lamp to show it.  Cavernous passages lead east, north and south.  On82      the west wall is scrawled the inscription, "Fee Fie Foe Foo" [sic].83      You are at one end of an immense N-S passage.84      You are in a magnificient cavern with a rushing stream, which cascades84      over a sparkling waterfall into a roaring whirlpool which disappears84      through a hole in the floor.  Passages exit to the south and west.85      You are in the soft room.  The walls are covered with heavy curtains,85      the floor with a thick pile carpet.  Moss covers the ceiling.86      This is the Oriental room.  Ancient oriental cave drawings cover the86      walls.  A gently sloping passage leads upward to the north, another86      passage leads SE, and a hands and knees crawl leads west.87      You are following a wide path around the outer edge of a large cavern.87      Far below, through a heavy white mist, strange splashing noises can be87      heard.  The mist rises up through a fissure in the ceiling.  The path87      exits to the south and west.88      You are in an alcove.  A small NW path seems to widen after a short88      distance.  An extremely tight tunnel leads east.  It looks like a very88      tight squeeze.  An eerie light can be seen at the other end.89      You're in a small chamber lit by an eerie green light.  An extremely89      narrow tunnel exits to the west.  A dark corridor leads NE.90      You're in the Dark room.  A corridor leading south is the only exit.91      You are in an arched hall.  A coral passage continues up and east.91      The air smells of sea water.92      You're in a large room carved out of sedimentary rock.  The floor and92      walls are littered with bits of shell embedded in the stone.  A shallow92      passage proceeds downward, and a somewhat steeper one leads up.  A low92      hands and knees passage enters from the south.93      You are in a long sloping corridor with ragged sharp walls.94      You are in cul-de-sac about eight feet across.95      You are in an anteroom leading to a large passage to the east.  Small95      passages go west and up.  The remnants of recent digging are evident.95      A sign in midair here says "Cave under construction beyond this point.95      Proceed at own risk. [Witt Construction Company]"96      You are at Witt's End.  Passages lead off in *all* directions.97      You are in a N-S canyon about 25 feet across.  The floor is covered by97      white mist seeping in from the north.  The walls extend upward for well97      over 100 feet.  Suspended from some unseen point far above you, an97      enormous two-sided mirror is hanging parallel to and midway between the97      canyon walls.  (The mirror is obviously provided for the use of the97      dwarves, who you know, are extremely vain.)  A small window can be seen97      in either wall, some 50 feet up.98      A large stalactite extends from the roof and almost reaches the floor98      below.  You could climb down it, and jump down to the floor, but having98      done so you would be unable to reach it to climb back up.99      You are on the southern edge of a large underground reservoir.  A99      thick cloud of white mist fills the room, rising from the surface99      of the water and drifting rapidly upwards.  The lake is fed by a99      stream, which tumbles out of a hole in the wall about 10 feet above99      and splashes noisily into the water near the reservoir's northern wall.99      A dimly-seen passage exits through the northern wall, but you can't get99      across the water to get to it.  Another passage leads south from here.100     You are at the northern edge of a large underground reservoir.  Across100     the water to the south, a dark passage is visible.  Another passage100     leads north from here.  Large, clawed tracks are visible in the damp100     ground, leading from the passage to the water.101     You are in a small chamber with warm walls.  Mist drifts into the101     chamber from a passage entering from the south and evaporates in101     the heat.  Another passage leads out to the northeast.102     You are in a high balcony carved out of solid rock overlooking a large,102     bare chamber lit by dozens of flickering torches.  A rushing stream102     pours into the chamber through a two-foot slit in the east wall and102     drains into a large pool along the north side of the chamber.  A small102     plaque riveted to the edge of the balcony reads, "You are looking at102     the Witt Company's main treasure room, constructed by the famous102     architect Ralph Witt in 4004 B.C. and dedicated to the proposition102     that all adventurers are created equal (although some are more equal102     than others).  NO ADMITTANCE VIA THIS ENTRANCE!"  A small, dark102     tunnel leads out to the west.103     At your feet all the water of the stream splashes into a 2-foot slit103     in the rock.  Downstream the streambed is bare rock.104     You are in a small cylindrical room with very smooth walls and a flat104     floor and ceiling.  There are no exits visible anywhere.105     You plunge into the stream and are carried down in total blackness.105     105     Deeper105            and105                deeper105                       you105                           go,105                               down105                                    into105                                         the105                                        very105                                 bowels105                              of105                          the105                    earth,105              until105         your105              lungs105                    are105                        aching105                               with105                                    the105                                        need105                                             for105                                                 fresh105                                                       air.105                                                           Suddenly,105                                                       with105                                                     a105                                             violent105                                                     >SPLASH!<105     105     you find yourself sitting on the edge of a pool of water in a vast105     chamber lit by dozens of flaring torches.105     105     The floor is covered with thick layers of precious Persian rugs!105     105     Rare coins, bars of silver and lumps of gold and platinum are105     strewn carelessly about!105     105     There are diamonds, rubies, sapphires, emeralds, opals, pearls and105     fabulous sculptures and ornaments carved out of jade and imperishable105     crystal, resting on display shelves, along with rare Ming vases and105     ancient Indian turquoise beads!105     105     A flotilla of ruby-encrusted toy boats is floating in the pool of105     water beside you!105     105     A network of golden chains supports a fantastic iridium crown!105     105     There is a display case on the wall filled with a fantastic selection105     of magical swords, which are singing "Hail to the Chief" in perfect105     pitch and rhythm!105     105     There are a dozen friendly little dwarves in the room, displaying their105     talents by deftly juggling hundreds of golden eggs!105     105     A large troll, a gigantic ogre and a bearded pirate are tossing knives,105     axes and clubs back and forth in a friendly demonstration of martial105     skill!105     105     A horde of cheerful little gooseberry goblins are performing talented105     acrobatics to an appreciative audience composed of a dragon, a large105     green snake, a cute little bird (which is sitting, unmolested, on the105     snake's head), a peaceful basilisk, and a large Arabian Djinn.105     105     Everyone turns and sees you, and lets out a heart-warming cheer105     of welcome!105     106     You are on one side of a large, deep chasm.  A heavy white mist rising106     up from below obscures all view of the far side.  A SW path leads away106     from the chasm into a winding corridor.107     You are on the far side of the chasm.  A NE path leads away from the107     chasm on this side.108     You are in a long winding corridor sloping out of sight in both108     directions.109     You are in a secret canyon which exits to the north and the east.110     You are in a secret canyon which exits to the north and the east.111     You're in a long E-W corridor. A faint rumbling noise can be heard111     in the distance.112     The path forks here.  The left fork leads northeast.  A dull rumbling112     seems to get louder in that direction.  The right fork leads southeast112     down a gentle slope.  The main corridor enters from the west.113     The walls are quite warm here.  From the north can be heard a steady113     roar, so loud that the entire cave seems to be trembling.  Another113     passage leads south, and a low crawl goes east.114     You are on the edge of a breathtaking view.  Far below you is an114     active volcano, from which great gouts of molten lava come surging114     out, cascading back down into the depths.  The glowing rock fills the114     farthest reaches of the cavern with a blood-red glare, giving every-114     thing an eerie, macabre appearance.  The air is filled with flickering114     sparks of ash and a heavy smell of brimstone.  The walls are hot to114     the touch, and the thundering of the volcano drowns out all other114     sounds.  Embedded in the jagged roof far overhead are myriad twisted114     formations composed of pure white alabaster, which scatter the murky114     light into sinister apparitions upon the walls.  To one side is a deep114     gorge, filled with a bizarre chaos of tortured rock which seems to114     have been crafted by the devil himself.  An immense river of fire114     crashes out from the depths of the volcano, burns its way through the114     gorge, and plummets into a bottomless pit far off to your left.114     Across the gorge, the entrance to a valley is dimly visible.  To114     the right, an immense geyser of blistering steam erupts continously114     from a barren island in the center of a sulfurous lake, which bubbles114     ominously.  The far right wall is aflame with an incandescence of its114     own, which lends an additional infernal splendor to the already114     hellish scene.  A dark, foreboding passage exits to the south.115     You are standing at the southern end of a long valley illuminated by115     flickering red light from the volcanic gorge behind you.  Carved into115     the walls of the valley is an incredible series of stone faces.  Some115     of them look down into the valley with expressions of benevolence that115     would credit a saint.  Others glare with a malice that makes the heart115     grow faint.  All of them are imbued with a fantastic seeming of life by115     the shifting and flickering light of the volcano.  The entire far end115     of the valley is taken up by an immense carving of a seated figure.115     Its exact form cannot be seen from here due to the uncertainty of the115     light.116     You are standing at the north end of the Valley of Stone Faces.116     Above you, an incredible bas-relief statue of an immense minotaur116     has been carved out of the rock.  At least sixty feet high, it sits116     gazing down at you with a faint but definite expression of amusement.116     Between its feet and the floor is a rock wall about ten feet high116     which extends across the entire north end of the valley.117     You are standing at the southern end of what appears to be a large117     room filled with multicolored fog.  The sides and far end of the room117     cannot be seen due to the thickness of the fog - it's a real pea-souper117     (even to the color in places).  A passage leads back to the south.117     A dull rumbling sound issues from the passage.118     119     You are standing in a fog-filled room next to a tall cairn of glowing119     rocks.  An opening in the cairn leads down to a dark passage.120     You are in a small, nondescript chamber.  A dark passage leads up120     and to the south, and a wide but low crawl leads north.121     You're in a small room with a very smooth rock floor, onto which121     has been marked a pentagram.  A low crawl leads out to the west, and121     a crack in the rock leads north.122     The crack in the rock ends here, but a narrow chimney leads up.122     You should be able to climb it.123     You're at the top of a narrow chimney in the rock.  A cylindrical123     tube composed of hardened lava leads south.124     The lava tube continues down and to the south, but it becomes very124     steep here - if you go down it you probably won't be able to get124     back up.125     You are in a narrow and rough passage running north and south.125     A dull rumbling sound can be heard from the south.126     You're in rough passage to the north of the basilisk's den.127     The passage enters here from the south and divides, with a wide127     tunnel exiting to the north and a set of steps leading downward.128     You are on a long, spiral set of steps leading downwards into the128     earth.129     A small tunnel exits from the steps and leads north.  The steps129     continue downwards.130     You're in what was once a storage room.  A set of steps lead up.131     You are in a large room, with a passage to the south, a passage to the131     west, and a wall of broken rock to the east.  There is a large "y2" on131     a rock in the room's center.132     You are in a jumble of rock, with cracks *everywhere*.133     You are in the catacombs.  Enchanted tunnels lead in all directions.134     You are in the catacombs.  Enchanted tunnels lead in all directions.135     You are in the catacombs.

The walls163     here are composed of the finest marble, and the floor is built of slabs163     of rare onyx and bloodstone.  The ceiling is high and vaulted, and is163     supported by pillars of rare Egyptian red granite.  It gives off a163     nacreous glow that fills the entire chamber with a light like moonlight163     shining off polished silver.164     You are at the eastern end of the Audience Hall.  There is a large dais164     rising out of the floor here.  Resting upon the dais is a strange164     looking throne made out of interlocking bars and rods of metal.165     You are in a winding passage which enters from the northwest,165     loops around several times, and exits to the north.166     You are in a chamber with golden walls and a high ceiling.  Passages166     lead south, northeast and northwest.167     You are in a small room whose walls are covered with an elaborate167     pattern of arabesque figures and designs.168     You are in a large room whose walls are composed of some translucent168     whitish mineral.  The room is illuminated by a flickering reddish glow168     shining through the southern wall.  A passage leads east.169     You are in a small chamber filled with large boulders.  The walls are169     very warm, causing the air in the room to be almost stifling.  The only169     exit is a crawl heading west, through which comes a low rumbling.170     You are walking along a gently sloping N-S passage lined with170     oddly shaped limestone formations.171     You are standing at the entrance to a large, barren room.  A sign171     posted above the entrance reads:  "Caution!  Bear in room!"172     You are inside a barren room.  The center of the room is completely172     empty except for some dust.  Marks in the dust lead away toward the172     far end of the room.  The only exit is the way you came in.173     You are in a small chamber to the east of the Hall of Mists.  The173     walls are composed of rough red sandstone.  There is a large, cubical173     chunk of rock in the center of the room.174     You are in a small room.  The walls are composed of a dark, almost174     black form of smoky quartz - they glisten like teeth in the lamp-light.174     The only exit is the passage to the south through which you entered.175     You are in a room with a high, vaulted ceiling.  A tunnel leads175     upwards and to the north.176     You are in the Peelgrunt room.177     You are inside the safe.178     You are standing in a wide, N-S corridor.179     You are standing at a bend in a wide corridor which runs to the east179     and west.  To the east, the corridor turns left and continues north;179     to the west, it turns left and continues south.180     You are in a small, low-ceilinged room with the words "Witt Company180     Tool Room - Melenkurion division" carved into one of the walls.  A180     wide corridor runs south from here.181     You are at a division in a narrow passage.  Two spurs run east and181     north; the main passage exits to the south.182     You are in a small, dank cubicle of rock.  A small passage leads back182     out to the south; there is no other obvious exit.183     You're in a large, completely spherical room with polished walls. A183     narrow passage leads out to the north.184     You are in a low tunnel with an irregular ceiling.  To the north, the184     tunnel is partially blocked by a recent cave-in, but you can probably184     get past the blockage without too much trouble.185     You're standing in a very large room (which however is smaller than the185     Giant room) which has smooth, glassy-looking walls.  A passage enters185     from the south and exits to the north.186     This is the Sorcerer's Lair.  The walls are covered with exotic runes186     written in strange indecipherable script.  The only readable phrase186     reads "noside samoht".  Strange shadows flit about on the walls, but186     there is nothing visible to cast them.  Iridescent blue light drips186     from a stalactite far above, falls towards the floor, and evaporates186     before touching the ground.  A deep, resonant chanting sound vibrates186     from deep in the ground beneath your feet, and a whispering sound186     composed of the echoes of long forgotten spells and cantrips seeps186     from the walls and fills the air.  Passages exit to the east and west.187     You are standing on the brink of what appears to be a bottomless pit187     plunging down into the bowels of the earth. Ledges run around the187     pit to the east and west, and a passage leads back to the north.188     You are standing on the south edge of a ledge running around the west188     side of a bottomless pit.  The ledge once continued around to the east188     side of the pit, but was apparently obliterated by a rock-slide188     years ago.  A cold wind blows out of a tunnel leading to the southeast.189     You are in the Ice room.  The walls and ceiling here are composed of189     clear blue glacial ice.  The floor is fortunately made of rock and is189     easy to walk upon.  There is a passage leading to the northwest, and a189     slide of polished ice leading downwards to the east - if you were to189     slide down it you probably couldn't get back up.190     You're at the entrance to an extensive and intricate network of tunnels190     carved out of solid ice.  A slippery slope leads upwards and north, but190     you cannot possibly climb up it.191     You are in an intricate network of ice tunnels.192     You are in an intricate network of ice tunnels.193     You are in an intricate network of ice tunnels.194     You are in an intricate network of ice tunnels.195     You are in an intricate network of ice tunnels.196     You are in an intricate network of ice tunnels.197     You are in an intricate network of ice tunnels.198     You are in an intricate network of ice tunnels.199     You are in an intricate network of ice tunnels.200     You are in an intricate network of ice tunnels.201     You are in an intricate network of ice tunnels.202     You are in an intricate network of ice tunnels.203     You are in an intricate network of ice tunnels.204     You are in an intricate network of ice tunnels.205     You are in an intricate network of ice tunnels.206     You are in an intricate network of ice tunnels.207     You are in an intricate network of ice tunnels.208     You are in an intricate network of ice tunnels.209     You are in an intricate network of ice tunnels.210     You are in an intricate network of ice tunnels.211     You are in an intricate network of ice tunnels.212     You are in an intricate network of ice tunnels.213     You are in an intricate network of ice tunnels.214     You are in an intricate network of ice tunnels.215     You are in an intricate network of ice tunnels.216     You are in an intricate network of ice tunnels.217     You are in an intricate network of ice tunnels.218     You are in an intricate network of ice tunnels.219     You are in an intricate network of ice tunnels.220     You are in an intricate network of ice tunnels.221     You are standing on the eastern side of a bottomless pit.  A narrow221     ledge runs north towards a dimly-visible passage; the ledge once221     continued south of this point but has been shattered by falling rock.221     A narrow crack in the rock leads northeast.222     You are following a narrow crack in the rock which enters from the222     southwest, turns and twists somewhat, and exits to the southeast.223     You are standing at the northern end of a rather tight passage. A223     narrow crack in the rock leads west.224     You are at the southern end of a tight passage.  A hand and knees224     crawl continues to the south.225     You are in a very small chamber.  A narrow crack leads north.226     You are in an arched coral passage, which enters from the west, splits,226     and continues on to the east over a smooth and damp-looking patch of226     sand.  The fork in the passage once led to the south, but it is now226     completely blocked by debris.227     You are at a bend in an arched coral passage; the passage enters227     from the west over a patch of damp sand, turns, and continues north.228     You are at a fork in a high, arched coral passage.  The main portion228     of the passage enters from the south; two smaller passages lead east228     and north.  The smell of salt water is very strong here.229     You are standing at the entrance to the Jonah room, a cavernous229     hall with high ribbed walls.  The hall extends far to the south;229     a coral passage leads west.230     You are at the south end of the Jonah room.  Ahead of you, the way230     is barred by a large set of immense stalactites and stalagmites230     which intermesh like clenched teeth.  Nothing except blackness is230     visible beneath the stone formations.231     You are in the Fourier passage.  This is a long and highly convoluted231     passage composed of coral, which twists and turns like the path of an231     earthworm tripping on LSD.  The passage here enters from the northwest,231     convulses, and exits to the southwest (from which direction can be felt231     a cool and salty-smelling breeze).232     You are standing on a large shelf of sedimentary rock overlooking a232     lava beach.  The shelf is an extension of an incredible cliff which232     extends north, south and upwards for as far as the eye can see.232     Crudely carved steps lead down from the shelf to the beach, and a232     twisting coral passage exits to the west.233     You are standing on a short, barren beach composed of hardened lava.233     Rugged and unclimbable volcanic hills block all view to the north and233     south, and a seemingly infinite cliff fills the entire western233     hemisphere.  To the east, a narrow inlet of ocean water laps gently233     upon the beach.  The scene is illuminated by the light of three small233     moons shining through the shimmering glow of an aurora that fills233     the entire sky with golden splendor.  Steps lead up the cliff to a233     shelf of rock.234     You are precariously perched on a tiny platform suspended in midair.234     Two thousand feet below you is the mouth of a very active volcano,234     spewing out a river of lava.235     You are in a little maze of twisting passages, all different.236     You are in an intricate network of ice tunnels.237     You are in an intricate network of ice tunnels.238     You are in an intricate network of ice tunnels.239     You are in an intricate network of ice tunnels.240     You are in an intricate network of ice tunnels.241     You are in a small chamber melted out of the ice.  Glowing letters241     in midair spell out the words "This way out."250     You are facing a wall at the northern end of the well house.  The wall250     (which was once white) has been blackened by smoke.  Faint footprints250     can be seen on the dusty floor around you.251     You are on a stairway below the trapdoor.  A glow of light is visible251     below.252     You are at the foot of a stairway that ascends into the darkness.252     A solitary bulb on the ceiling casts an eerie glow, revealing passages252     heading north and south.  A faded sign on the wall reads:252     252                              EMERGENCY EXIT252     253     The southern passage ends here.254     You have reached the junction of three corridors, running south, east254     and west.  The eastern route is marked by a large red "P" painted on254     the wall.  An equally large black "N" marks the western passage.255     You are walking along an east-west corridor.256     You are outside a room at the end of a corridor that heads west.  A sign256     above the doorway reads "Mirror Room Entrance".257     You are walking along an east-west passage.258     The western passage ends at a rocky ledge above a pathway.  You could258     jump down to the pathway but you probably couldn't climb back up.259     You are inside the Mirror Room, surrounded by a multitude of perplexed259     explorers who peer at you intently, mimicking your every move.260     You are outside a room at the end of a corridor that heads east.  A sign260     above the doorway reads "Mirror Room Entrance".261     You are at the top of a gently sloping pathway that curves as it descends261     in either direction.  Above you is a rocky ledge.300     You have entered a hay-field at the bottom of the hill, which lies to300     your south.  There is a curious structure here (which you happen to300     know is called a Dutch Cap).  It resembles a hip roof hung about300     halfway up four poles.  Its purpose in life seems to be to keep the300     rain and sun off the hay that is piled up under it.301     You are in Limbo (GLITCH!). Say OUT to get out of here.
