                          AdventureII restored                             Mike Arnautov                              30 Sep 2001(See contents.txt for details of the contents of this distribution.)Written in 1978 by Peter Luckett and Jack Pike in the then standardFortran66, AdventureII was one of the early expansion of the originalgame. For over a decade, this version was believed to be lost, known only asone of the two versions merged by me into Adv660 (AdventureII a.k.a. Adv440, and Dave Platt's Adv550).  However, such are the wonders of oldarchives, that most of the game source was rediscovered when an oldPrime was being wound down towards the end of 1999, in the run-up to theY2K non-event. Unfortunately, it turned out that while the program source wasapparently complete, the database was not.  The travel table, the objectlocation table, the vocabulary and the hints table -- all these weremissing. That's how things stood for another couple of years, until one Septemberday of 2001 Jack Pike got in touch!  He'd been sitting in a hotel in theUS and while waiting for something else, idly typed his name into Google-- and was astonished to see an adventure reference.  The link was to mymipmip site (at demon.co.uk at the tim) and the rest was easy. As I'd hoped, Jack did have the full database and another copy of theprogram, but only in two formats: as a hard copy and on an oldDEC-format magnetic tape.  A closer inspection of the goodies revealed afurther startling fact -- Jack's database didn't match any of theprogram versions either of us had. I won't bore you with details, but after some fairly intense softwarearcheology work (and, of course, a lot of typing!), we now have an F77source and the database to go with it.  To the best of our knowledge itcomes as close as possible to being a faithful reproduction of the"AdventureII experience". Hope you enjoy it!                                - o O o -
