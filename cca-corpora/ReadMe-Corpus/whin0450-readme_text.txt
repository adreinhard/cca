			Febuary 5th, 2007.		Description of AdventureCCaw1 For 32 bit MS-Windows Console.			Al Whinery of Maryland.		Credits to previous authors given in game introduction.****************************************************************************************************************	This is the 350-point version with optional 400 and 450 levels.	You must achieve the 350-point game to get the extra points.	My main goals were to make the game less tedious.	In the process I added many new features.****************************************************************************************************************	System requirments:	Disk space:   At least  220 KB.	Memory (RAM): Less than 800 KB.****************************************************************************************************************	Files needed in one directory to play:	ADVENT0.DAT	ADVENT1.DAT	ADVENT2.DAT	ADVENT3.DAT	ADVENT4.DAT	ADVENT5.DAT	AdventureCCaw1.exe	AdventureCCaw1_ReadMe.txt	(Don't really need this file.)	Good commands to try:	info	help	help help     -- this lists verbs and movements.	help verb     -- where verb is in the list from the help help command.****************************************************************************************************************I borrowed this description from a walk through file by someone else:The goal is to find all the treasures and take them back to the well housebefore the game ends.If you don't get killed by a little dwarf and if the pirate showsup before you finish, you can get all the points.When you get well into the cave you will encounter some nasty dwarves.  Thefirst one simply tosses an axe at you and runs away.  The axe misses.  Get theaxe; you'll need it when you see the dwarves again.  On your second encounterwith the dwarves, you'll see one or more, who will throw knives at you.  Thefirst salvo always misses.  Toss the axe at a dwarf, fetch it again, and keeptossing until you have killed all the dwarves present.  You'll need to do thiseach time a dwarf appears.  If you don't, you'll get killed.  (Be sure toretrieve the axe after you have killed the last dwarf that is with you.)Don't worry if a pirate appears and steals your treasures from you.  You'llfind them again later on.If the pirate never appears, you probably won't make it.  When you reach thedead end where the chest is supposed to be, you could backtrack (if you knowhow) through the maze and then forward again until he appears.  If this takestoo many turns your lamp batteries will wear out before the end game, and thenit's tough beans.****************************************************************************************************************My intrest in this game started after I built my first computer ( Heathkit H8 with an H9 terminal ) in the late 1970s.Heathkit made the game available and I mastered it but I had to cheat to find out how to get the last point.****************************************************************************************************************Notice of good faith:	At time of distribution, it is my best belief that this is a non-malicious program.Disclaimer:	This is freeware intended for enjoyment	 and none of the authors	 shall be held responsible for any damage caused by it's use.Caution:	Always scan new programs for viruses and other infections.
