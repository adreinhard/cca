Adventure for MS-DOS:  Rehost of DECUS 11-340If you've just un-ZIPed ADVENT.ZIP (or whatever the file was called whenyou downloaded it) you have all that's needed to play Adventure.The original RT-11 distribution is packed in RT11SRC.ZIP.  The originalADVENT.DOC documentation file is there.  File SOURCES.ZIP containsthe modified sources for Microsoft Fortran 77 under MS-DOS.  There is asuitably updated ADVENT.DOC file there.  My doc files refer to what'son the "root" of the disk and what's in subdirectories.  I've packed thearchive this way, with embedded ZIPs for the subdirectories, so I couldwarn you to not unpack the two subdirectories into the same place.The material in RT11SRC is an uncorrected "ASCII Squirt" over a serialline from our dear departed PDP 11/03 to a PC.  There are some straylines at the top and bottom of each file.  Also, the source code isformatted via tabs, rather than spaces.  This stuff was cleaned out ofthe re-host, but not the raw stuff.  File names are unchanged, so don'tmix the two source sets.This program, as built under Microsoft Fortran 4.01, works perfectly.There is an odd problem when built under 5.0.  If you scroll down inthis file, you'll find a statement of what that is.  (I have not tried5.1 or Power Station.)  Telling the problem amounts to being a spoiler,so I've hidden it below.Ken Plotkinkplotkin@access.digex.netOctober, 1994Here it comesWhen built under MSF 5.0, the magic wand (black rod) does not do itsthing when waved at the fissure.  Exact same code works just fine under4.01.This problem has driven me crazy.  Anybody who can figure out what'swrong will receive a suitable reward:  Scott Adams's "Adventureland" and"Pirate's Adventure" rewritten in Fortran IV for a DEC PDP 11/03.
