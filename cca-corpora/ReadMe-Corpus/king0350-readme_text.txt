This is the 350 point version of Adventure, converted from the originalFortran to C by Jim Gillogly at The Rand Corporation. Jim's source was thenincorporated into the BSD Unix distribution. This Amiga port is built fromthe source in the NetBSD distribution.When this version of Adventure is run from the Workbench, a file requesterto load in a saved game opens. To start a new game, just cancel therequester.David Kinderkinder@teaching.physics.ox.ac.uk(19th November 1996)The following license is from the source code:	$NetBSD: adventure.6,v 1.2 1995/03/21 12:04:57 cgd Exp $ Copyright (c) 1991, 1993	The Regents of the University of California.
