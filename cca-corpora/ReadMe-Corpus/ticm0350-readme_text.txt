Hello Adventurers,this is a standard FORTRAN 77 port of "Adventure", the legendary workby Willie Crowther and Don Woods that has given its name to a wholegenre of computer games.Read "freeware.txt" and "adventure.doc" for more info. These files areunmodified from the DECUS r4 distribution, so the compilationinstructions are invalid for Linux and most other non-DEC systems.The port is (to the best of my knowledge) standard FORTRAN 77 and itwas developed on a Linux machine with GNU g77. Probably it isrelatively easy to get it to work on other Unix or Unix-like systemswith a Fortran 77 compiler, read the Makefile to find out how.Just type "make" (without the quotes) to compile and "advent" to run.Compiling and running this program requires that you have GNU g77installed.  Most probably g77 is part of your Linux distribution CD,but it might not have been installed to your hard disk yet. Read thedistribution's documentation to find out how to install additional,optional packages.  Chances are rather high that the package's namestarts with "g77", or maybe "f77", or "fortran".Since enough information about the game can be found in the if-archiveat ftp://ftp.ifarchive.org in various sub-directories, I'll justdescribe this port.  The origin of this port, DECUS AdventureMaintenace Release 4, is the version distributed by DEC as freewaresince 1994, which in turn is a minor update of the 1977 version forthe DEC PDP-11, which is a port of the DEC PDP-10 "350 points" versionby Woods, which is based on a score-less program by Crowther, whichwas based on a number of real-life cave expeditions of Crowther andothers into the Bedquilt Cave area of the Flint Ridge cave system inKentucky during the 60s and early 70s.The "Crowther version" being more of a simulation than a game, the"Crowther/Woods version" is generally considered to be "The OriginalAdventure".As the PDP-10 FORTRAN compiler had a pretty large amount ofstrangeness and non-compatibility built-in, the PDP-11 version is thebest starting point for a new port. There are numerous MS-DOS versionsflying around the net, so I decided to do a general FORTRAN 77 port.If you're looking for a faithful DOS version (based on DECUS Release3), try ftp://ftp.gmd.de/if-archive/games/pc/adv350kp.zipThe "atext.txt" database file is unmodified, and changes in the sourcecode were kept down to a minimum, just to make the code compilecorrectly.  (mostly: replacing TYPE with PRINT, declaring everythingthat ought to be as LOGICAL, reformatting continuation lines to getrid of the odd DEC tab scheme, and replacing x.OR.y etc. with OR(x,y)for non-LOGICAL values.)This code now works (with some warnings) with g77's "-pedantic-errors"option, so I really don't see why it shoudn't run on any Unix clonewith a decent FORTRAN 77 compiler.Note: The current g77 compiler complains about CALL IDATE not beingy2k compliant. However, since this is only used to initialize therandom number generator, it doesn't really matter.Note that this version looks for the database file "atext.txt" in thedirectory "/usr/local/lib/advent", which should be OK on mostUnices. If that's not what you want, edit "ainit.f", search for"atext.txt" and prefix it with a path that suits you (say"/usr/lib/advent/" ?), then modify the LIBDIR variable in the Makefileand remake.If a users saves the game, the game state is currently written intothe file ".asave" in the current directory. This can be changed in"asubr.f", just do a search for ".asave" (it occurs twice).If you're using a non-Unixy system (VMS, "Mess-Does-Win-Dough" stuffor whatever else) which has a FORTRAN 77 compiler, you're on your ownconcerning the build process, however the code should work withoutmodifications, the exceptions being the 3 file accesses mentionedabove, in which the paths must very probably be changed.This package was only tested on Linux/i386, so please report anyproblems arising on other machines to me, as well as other comments,send to:ticmanis@coli.uni-sb.deBUG: This text has no structure.Happy Adventuring, Linards Ticmanis.
