This ZIPped file, i.e., HUGECAVE.ZIP, contains all of the source files needed
to create a working version of the game HUMONGOUS CAVE.

The specific files are:

   HUGECAVE.AGT -- The first part of the HUMONGOUS CAVE game AGT source code.

   HUGEROOM.AGT -- The second part of the HUMONGOUS CAVE game AGT source code.
                   This file is called by HUGECAVE.AGT as an "include" file.

   HUGECAVE.VOC -- The "vocabulary" file for HUMONGOUS CAVE.

   CAVEHINT.TXT -- The source file for the "pop-up" hints for HUMONGOUS CAVE.
                   This file must be converted into a .HNT file by using the
                   program MAKEHINT.EXE.  Then you will need to use the
                   program POPHINT.EXE to actually use the hints when you play
                   HUMONGOUS CAVE.

   CAVE-SOL.PT1 -- The first part of the solution (a complete "walk-thru").
   CAVE-SOL.PT2 -- The second part of the solution.
   CAVE-SOL.PT3 -- The third part of the solution.
   CAVE-SOL.PT4 -- The fourth part of the solution.

   HUGECAVE.DOC -- The file you are now reading.
