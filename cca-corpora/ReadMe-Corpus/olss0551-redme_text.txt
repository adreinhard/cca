This is the 551 point enhanced version of the classic Adventure game(aka Colossal Cave). It seems to be a superset of the original game,with several new rooms and puzzles added (I haven't played this versionvery much). It runs under MS/PC-DOS version 3.3; I haven't tried otherDOS versions.This version was compiled by me in September, 1990 from sources publishedin Comp.sources.games in August the same year. I've made one modification:the SAVE and RESTORE routines now prompt you for a filename, enablingyou to make multiple save files (you can make that anyway by quitting andrenaming, so I see no point in allowing just one save file, though puristsmay consider that cheating).To run the game, just type ADVENT at the DOS prompt. The program willprompt you for instructions.DISCLAIMER: NO RESPONSIBILITY WHATSOEVER IS TAKEN FOR ANY POSSIBLE LOSS OR DAMAGE CAUSED BY RUNNING THIS PROGRAM.Magnus Olssonmagnus@thep.lu.se
