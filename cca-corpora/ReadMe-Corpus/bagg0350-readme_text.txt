Thanks!IMPORTANT NOTE--------------This archive contains the machine-independent version of the game.That means that the .GAM file enclosed here will run on any machinethat has a TADS 2.1.0 (or later) run-time program.  It also means,however, that the version of the run-time for *your* system is notincluded in this archive, and you will have to get it separately(probably from the same place you got this archive).If you're now extremely annoyed that you can't play the game you justdownloaded, we apologize!  But there are simply too many machinesrunning TADS now for us to make an archive that will support all ofthem "out of the box."  Also, packaging the games this way saves space,since we don't have to include the run-time program in each archive.Once you have the run-time program for your system (usually called "tr"or "tadsr"), you can run the game by typing	tadsr <game>where <game> is the filename of the TADS .GAM file.Help!-----If you can't find the TADS system for your machine anywhere, contactHigh Energy Software:    High Energy BBS:       The fastest way to reach us is through the High Energy BBS.
