Adventure was the very first text adventure, written by Will Crowther andDon Woods, circa 1977. The original (which had a maximum score of 350points) has been modified and extended by many people.This is a port of the version maintained by Bob Supnik for Decus (The DecUsers' Group). The port has an Amiga specific front-end, with proper commandline editing and a command line history (use the cursor up/down keys to stepthrough previously entered commands). It requires at least Kickstart 2.04.The porting was performed by	David Kinder	davidk@monis.co.ukWhat follows is the original description from the source archive:To:	Adventure PlayersFrom:	Adventure MaintenanceDate:	1-Feb-94Subj:	Game InformationI.  Adventure, Release 4Adventure, Release 4, is a maintenance release of Adventure.The release kit contains the following files:	-advent.f	main program.	-ainit.f	initialization.	-amain.f	game.	-asubr.f	subroutines.	-aparam.for	parameters.	-advent.doc	documentation file.	-atext.txt	game data base file.The primary changes incorporated in Release 4 are the following:	-Longer length vocabulary (8 letter words).	-Elimination of disk-based database file.	-Portability for UNIX.II. HistoryThis version of Adventure is based on two previous versions:	-A Fortran-10 version done by Willie Crowther and	 Don Woods.	-A Fortran-IV-Plus version done by Kent Blackett.	-A Fortran-IV version done by Bob Supnik.In altering the program to compile under Fortran-IV, the followingwere made:	-Magic mode (maintenance mode) was removed.	-Section 12 of the data base (magic texts) was removed.	-The HOURS command was removed.III. Installation Instructions (OpenVMS)To create an executable image, issue the following commands:	$ FORTRAN/NOCHECK ADVENT.F(cr)	$ FORTRAN/NOCHECK AMAIN.F(cr)	$ FORTRAN/NOCHECK AINIT.F(cr)	$ FORTRAN/NOCHECK ASUBR.F(cr)	$ LINK ADVENT,AMAIN,AINIT,ASUBR(cr)The linked program can be executed with the command:	$ RUN ADVENT(cr)The program will print a short initialization message andstart running.  It no longer creates any working files.IV. Installation Instructions (OSF/1)To create an executable image, issue the following commands:	% f77 -vms -align dcommons *.f -o advent(cr)The linked program can be executed with the command:	% advent(cr)The program will print a short initialization message andstart running.  It no longer creates any working files.Abstract of Informational Printouts--SUMMARY-------Somewhere nearby is Colossal Cave, where others have found fortunes intreasure and gold, though it is rumored that some who enter are neverseen again.  Magic is said to work in the cave.  I will be your eyesand hands.  Direct me with commands of 1 or 2 words.  I should warnyou that I look at only the first eight letters of each word.(Should you get stuck, type "HELP" for some general hints.  For infor-mation on how to end your adventure, etc., type "INFO".)			- - -This program was originally developed by Willie Crowther.  Most of thefeatures of the current program were added by Don Woods (DON @ SU-AI).The current version was done by Kent Blackett and Bob Supnik.			- - -Bug reports and other correspondence should be sent to:	Digital Equipment Computer Users Society	One Iron Way, MR2-3/E55	Marlboro, Mass. 01752	Attn:  Adventure MaintenanceHELP----I know of places, actions, and things.  Most of my vocabularydescribes places and is used to move you there.  To move, try wordslike "FOREST", "DOWNSTREAM", "ENTER", "EAST", "WEST", "NORTH", "SOUTH","UP", or "DOWN".  I know about a few special objects, like a black rodhidden in the cave.  These objects can be manipulated using some ofthe action words that I know.  Usually you will need to give both theobject and action words (in either order), but sometimes I can inferthe object from the verb alone.  Some objects also imply verbs; inparticular, "INVENTORY" implies "TAKE INVENTORY", which causes me togive you a list of what you're carrying.  The objects have sideeffects; for instance, the rod scares the bird.  Usually people havingtrouble moving just need to try a few more words.  Usually peopletrying unsuccessfully to manipulate an object are attempting somethingbeyond their (or my!) capabilities and should try a completelydifferent tack.  To speed the game you can sometimes move longdistances with a single word.  For example, "BUILDING" usually getsyou to the building from anywhere above ground except when lost in theforest.  Also, note that cave passages turn a lot, and that leaving aroom to the north does not guarantee entering the next from the south.Good luck!INFO----If you want to end your adventure early, say "QUIT".  To suspend youradventure such that you can continue later, say "SUSPEND" (or "PAUSE"or "SAVE").  To see what hours the cave is normally open, say "HOURS".To see how well you're doing, say "SCORE".  To get full credit for atreasure, you must leave it safely in the building, though you getpartial credit just for locating it.  You lose points for gettingkilled, or for quitting, though the former costs you more.  There arealso points based on how much (if any) of the cave you've managed toexplore; in particular, there is a large bonus just for getting in (todistinguish the beginners from the rest of the pack), and there areother ways to determine whether you've been through some of the moreharrowing sections.  If you think you've found all the treasures, justkeep exploring for a while.  If nothing interesting happens, youhaven't found them all yet.  If something interesting DOES happen,it means you're getting a bonus and have an opportunity to garner manymore points in the master's section.  I may occasionally offer hintsif you seem to be having trouble.  If I do, I'll warn you in advancehow much it will affect your score to accept the hints.  Finally, tosave paper, you may specify "BRIEF", which tells me never to repeatthe full description of a place unless you explicitly ask me to.
