Hello! Welcome to the Original Adventure!!Introduction.Somewhere nearby is colossal cave, where others have found fortunes intreasure and gold, though it is rumoured that some who enter are neverseen again. Magic is said to work in the cave. This program will be youreyes and hands.This program was originally developed by Willie Crowther at StanfordUniversity Artificial Intelligence Lab, and derives from the roll playinggame "Dungeons and Dragons".  Most of the features of the current programwere added by Don Woods. The current version was done by Bob Supnik. Thisversion was implemented on the IBM-PC (and compatibles) by Kevin Black.Command input.The very rudimentary parser of this program will accept two word commands,of the verb-nown variety, single words may be used where the meaning isobvious, for example "NORTH" is sufficient to mean "GO NORTH". The parseronly examines the first four letters of each word you use, any more areignored. As with most text adventures commonly used commands can beabbreviated :      N  - NORTH       S  - SOUTH       E  - EAST        W  - WEST      NE -NORTHEAST    NW - NORTHWEST   SE - SOUTHEAST   SW - SOUTHWEST      U  - UP          D  - DOWN        L  - LOOK        I  - INVENTORYDescriptions of locations and related commandsThe command "LOOK" is useful should you forget where you are or require,the long description of your location. You are normally only give the longdescription of a location the first time, on further visits you are givena short description which is usually enough to jog your memory as towhere you are. The command "BRIEF" will tell the program to always usethe short descriptions of a location, even on the first visit. Theopposite of "BRIEF" is "VERBOSE".Game management commands.Should you wish to quit the program (Control-C is disabled to prevent'accidents') use the command "QUIT", on exit you will be given yourscore and rating! If you wish to know your score during play use thecommand "SCORE".When you look at your watch at four in the morning and decide you wouldlike to go to bed it would be nice to save the game wouldn't it? Wellyou can do this with the "SAVE" command which will prompt you for a filename. A saved game may be restarted with the command "RESTORE" (or"RESUME"), this command prompts for the file in which the game wassaved. The save and restore functions use a CRC to check file integrity.Some online information is available with the commands "HELP" and "INFO".Message encryption.The file containing the location descriptions has been encrypted, thisprevents you from spoiling the game for your self by peeking at it! Justthought I would mention that!Running the gameThe game requires the two files ADVENTUR.CTL and ADVENTUR.MTX to be in thedirectory from which you run the game, which you do by entering ADV. If theprogram does not find these files it will look for a database file, andfailing to find this will print an error message. Messing around with thefiles will prevent the program from running properly.                                                       Kevin B Black                                                       December 1987
