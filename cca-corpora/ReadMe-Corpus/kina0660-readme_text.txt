Adventure was the very first text adventure, written by Will Crowther andDon Woods, circa 1977. The original (which had a maximum score of 350points) has been modified and extended by many people.This extended 660 point version is by Mike Arnautov, based on earlierversions by Peter Luckett, Jack Pike and David Platt.This port has an Amiga specific front-end, with proper command line editing,a command line history (use the cursor up/down keys to step throughpreviously entered commands) and file requesters for the save and restoreoperations. They require at least Kickstart 2.04. The porting was performedby	David Kinder	kinder@teaching.physics.ox.ac.ukThis is release 1.1, which corrects a problem with the file requesters.What follows is Mike Arnautov's original description:========================================================================Hello and welcome to Adventure4!  No, this is not Yet-Another-Adventure variant.  It may stick to a singleverb/noun commands (shock , horror!  - no adjectives, no prepositions...not even a special kludge for putting objects into other objects!!), butit has something many other pretenders do not have - character. To  start with, Adventure4 re-merges the two divergent extensions of thethe original game (Peter Luckett's and Jack Pike's Adventure II and DavePlatt's Adventure 550), with some minor improvements all of its own. More  importantly,  however, the game had benefited from being a part ofan official games package on a very large installation, which allowed meto  scan  through  literally thousands of game logs generated by a largenumber of players.  Adventure4 incorporates a  number  of  modificationsand  improvements,  based solely on this unique experience of seeing thegame as it is played and *not*  as  the  author  might  have  wished  orexpected  it to be played.  Judging from players' feedback, it does makea difference. If you have a hard disk, I suggest you copy over to it both ADV4.EXE andADVENTUR.DAT.  The text database size is far too large for most  PCs  tohold in memory, so the game constantly accesses the data file.  ADV4.EXEdoes a lot of clever internal buffering to make up  for  this,  and  thegame  *is*  playable  from  a  floppy,  but  there is no point sufferingneedlessly, is there? Anyway,  have  a  go  and  see  what you think!  Afterwards, if you feelstrongly enough about it, don't  hesitate  to  let  me  know  what  yourthoughts were, be they rude or polite - all opinions welcome.                                         3rd November, 1991                                        Mike Arnautov                                         Glaxo Group Research,                                        Greenford Road,                                        Greenford,                                        Middlesex UB6 0HE,                                        England.                                        mla1290@ggr.co.uk
