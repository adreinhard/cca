
     This game of Adventure was ported from a DEC PDP-11 system and converted
     to work with Microsoft Fortran.  The game was distributed freely in
     DEC-land through DECUS (DEC User Society) so why not distribute it
     freely in PC-land...

     The Adventure runtime system is driven by a file, FILES.ADV, in which
     the names of the files must be listed.

     The ordering of the file entries is as follows:

	STABLE.ADV      - Symbol table
	RINDEX.ADV      - Record index
	INSTO.ADV       - Instruction
	TEXTO.ADV       - Text

     For example, you can store the game files in \GAMES directory and play
     from any directory as long as FILES.ADV is in your directory:

	\GAMES\STABLE.ADV             STABLE.ADV \
	\GAMES\RINDEX.ADV      or     RINDEX.ADV  \ assumes all in current
	\GAMES\INSTO.ADV              INSTO.ADV   /  directory
	\GAMES\TEXTO.ADV              TEXTO.ADV  /

     This file allows multiple Adventure games to be run on a single system
     using the Runtime system, by merely having different FILES.ADV files in
     separate sub-directories.


     GAME HINTS:

       1) The first time through the game, map every room, take hints and
          identify treasures.  When you are ready to complete the game, don't
          waste turns wandering aimlessly.  This is essential because if you
          intend to finish the game, you will need as much lamp power as
          possible.
          
       2) Do not buy batteries when you want to complete the game.  They
          require coins (a treasure) to obtain them from the vending machine.

       3) You get points for just visiting some rooms, be sure to identify
          these rooms.

       4) Some rooms has shortcuts to other rooms.  One such shortcut is
          from BEDQUILT room to SLAB room (say SLAB in BEDQUILT room).
          These shortcuts save lamp usage.

       5) Map mazes by dropping objects in rooms and mapping directions from
          that object.  Carry as many objects as possible.

       6) You must know 16 magical words to complete the game (XYZZY, FEE,
          FIE, etc)...

       If you get stuck, leave a message with The MSG BBS (312-830-7572).
       I will try and respond with an answer as soon as possible.
