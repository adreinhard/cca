  This archive contains all the versions of Mike Goetz's ports of Adventureto CP/M that I can find.  There is one 350-point version (version A02; whether A00 and A01 exist is unknown), two 550-point versions (B00 and B01) and one 580-point version (A02).  Both 550-point versions have exactly the same game database; the differenceis that version B00 will not run on an 8080 CPU, whereas B01 will. The databaseis almost exactly the same as Dave Platt's 550-point version, though somespelling errors have crept in (was it manually typed in from a printout?)  The 580-point version contains an area which (as far as I know) is uniqueto this game; it is accessed from Witt's End.   The advdis directory contains tools to extract some approximation to A-codesource from the version B games; it also contains documentation on the database file format used by these games.  The runtimes for the B-version adventures are, I would guess, compiledFORTRAN. I don't know what compiler was used (maybe Microsoft FORTRAN?) butits code generator produces terribly flabby code.
