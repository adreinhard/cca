ADVD64.ZIP contains a "D64" image of a Commodore 64 disk containing textadventures.  Most notably it contains a BASIC version of theoriginal Adventure.  The programs obviously run on a Commodore 64, andalso run on the various C-64 emulators.ADVBOOT, SNVTR, and ADVENTURE are a condensed port of Adventure, done byJim Butterfield in May 1981.  ADVBOOT is a short program that loadsSNVTR.  It appears that ADVENTURE is a single program version ofADVBOOT/SNVTR, but I have not traced things enough to really see.OHARES3 and QUEST30 are self-standing adventures.  I have a port ofQUEST to PC GWBASIC, but I believe there are already several at theIF-ARCHIVE.These programs were all on a disk I obtained from the Capital AreaCommodore Enthusiasts club library in 1985 or so.  I suspect the originwas the Toronto Pet User's Group.CBMADV.ZIP contains the programs (not the data files) extracted to PCfiles, de-tokenized via Reed Meyer's program CBM2ASC.  No attempt hasbeen made to convert to any of the PC BASICs.  These files have beenprepared for the benefit of those who want to study the code, butnot get involved with a C-64.Thanks to Dave Doherty for pointing out that this was a "lost" versionof Adventure, and to all of the Commodore 64transfer/translator/emulator authors for their incredible programs.Ken Plotkinkplotkin@access.digex.netMarch 1995
