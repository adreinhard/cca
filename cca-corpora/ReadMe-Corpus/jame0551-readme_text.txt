Original README below. The sources have been updated to compile on F77 under Acorn's Panos Operating system. Panos F77 does not have IOR, IAND and IEOR.

It is based on a version close to theseriously non-portable (and buggy) version for Primes posted last spring. Ihave done a fair job of cleaning it up, portabilizing it, and debugging, butit is still Fortran spaghetti. For you with no Fortran compilers, this is theexcuse you need to get "f2c" working!!! It has worked on the IBM-PC, VMS, theMIPS 120, the IBM RISCstation 600, the VAX/Ultrix, and a Prime. It willhowever expose toy Fortran compilers as just that - toys. I would like tothank Larry Estep for finding some hidden bugs.For those that have not experienced this, the very first text adventure game,it is a romp through the darkest reaches of Colossal Cave in search ofriches. You will find evocative descriptions of the darker, more mysteriousplaces of the earth, and severely test your abilities to map thecontortions of the cave. You will find some hard - and some deceptivelyeasy - puzzles to solve.Doug McDonald
